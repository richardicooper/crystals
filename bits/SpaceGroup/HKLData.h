 /*** Naming conventions ***
 ** Variable/Constant **
 * These conventions should be followed as closely as possible when coding in the file.
 * All variable names should start with one of the following lower case letters.
 * t - variables which are declared locally to the method/function
 * i - variables which are members of the object.
 * g - variables which are global to the file.
 * p - variables which are parameters to a method/function.
 * k - constants
 *
 * All variables should be have descriptive names which. Should use capitalization in 
 * variable names.
 *
 * e.g.. 
 * double tSomeVariable;   //A variable which is declared inside method.
 * double pSomeParameter   //A variable which is a parameter to a method/function
 *
 ** Classes/Structures/Typedefs **
 * All these should have the first letter as a capital and the first letter of any word 
 * in the name should be a capital letter. All other letters should be lower case.
 * 
 * e.g.
 * class MyClass
 * {
 * 	function name	
 * };
