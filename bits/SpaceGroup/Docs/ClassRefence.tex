\section{Introduction}
This document is a description of all the files and classes used in the space group determination program, TheDeterminator . It is meant as a reference to the code of the program for improved maintenance. When an alteration is made to the source code this document should be updated.

This file was created for my third year undergraduate project and was used for classes which had a general use. Classes which cannot be obviosly grouped together and can be used in any type of project should be up into this file.\\\\
In ComClasses.h there is a preprocessor flag __DEBUGGING__. This should be defined when the project is being debugged. (This will later be changed so that there will be a debug flag for each class.
