        <h4>Multiplicity of Observations</h4>

        <p>The left hand image has a peak at a multiplicity of 7-9, and a very substantial
        number of reflections having a multiplicity of 20 or more. <br /> The intention of the 
        experiment was to observe most data at a MoO of about 8, but because of the
        nature of area detectors, this means that a lot of the data will have a much 
        higher MoO. Since the standard deviation
        of a reflection is given by <i>standard deviation of sample)/ &radic;(MoO)</i>
        these high MoO reflections will have an abnormally low <i>standard deviation of 
        the mean</i>, i.e. a low s.u. of the merged intensity.        

        <br /><br />

        The inset below is data from a data collection which was terminated early.
        Because the predicted strategy was interrupted, most reflections were measured
        with a low MoO, especially at high resolution.
