<h4> Completeness</h4>
<p>
An almost solid row of blue crosses at the top - 
good sign - high completeness.  <br>
Missing Data: A few low angle reflections missing (probably 
behind the beam stop)- Not usually important.  If the blue crosses
fall off at high angle, you can click on the graph at the theta max
at which you believe the data to be more-or-less complete.<br>
The inset shows data from a  <a href="./cropped.jpg">
poorly diffracting poly-peptide</a>. The 
structure was difficult to solve, and refined to a conventional R=8%
with data down to 2 sigma.<br>

<h4>Sigma Frequency</h4>
<p>
There are very few reflections below -2 sigma - i.e. no badly negative 
reflections.  From the blue line you can see that about 5400 out of 
the 7000 reflections have I/sigma(I) &GT; 3.  The listing file should
give the exact figure. 77% of this data is reliably observable. If the
figure falls below 50% you can expect problems with structure solution
and refinement.

<h4>Sigma vs Resolution</h4>
<p>
The green curve shows that the very reliable data fades away at
[sin(theta)/lambda]<sup>2</sup> of about 0.3. As normal, 
the weak data (red) is mostly at high resolution.  The yellow curve
is the cumulative sum, and is scaled to fit the chart (in this example
by being multiplied by 10). 
It shows that the mean I/sigma(I) is about 2 at 0.36 resolution. This
is typical of an 'ordinary' data set.  Weakly diffracting crystals
fall below the 2-sigma threshold at a lower resolution.<br>
The inset shows the data for the same poor crystal described above<br>

<h4>Wilson Plot</h4>
<p>
This shows the usual ripple due to repeated molecular motifs.
The gradient gives an estimate of the overall adp, the intercept
an estimate of the overall scale of the data. Note the conventional
use of <b>B</b> for the adp. <br>
B=8.pi<sup>2</sup>U <br>
Low values of <b>MOD[E<sup>2</sup>-1] </b> (&lt; 0.74) may
indicate twinning.<br>
If the high-rho end of the curve is ragged, 
or shows an up-turn (due to systematic over-estimation of weak 
reflections), a maximum value of rho for the
rest of the analysis can be selected by right-clicking
on the appropriate blue cross.  This value can be reset
at any time in the REFINEMENT/FILTERING menu. The LIST 28
check box enables you so see the effect of reflection filters.<br>

heavy atoms or repeated molecular motifs

<h4>Residual</h4>
<p> Plots &lt;(Fo-Fc)<sup>2</sup>&gt; vs Fc and resolution (red)
and &lt;w(Fo-Fc)<sup>2</sup>&gt; vs Fc and resolution (blue).
The blue bars should all be very short and centred at about 1.0.  
In this example there is a systematic trend as a function of both
Fc and resolution.  Since high angle reflections are generally weak,
these two curves are saying more or less the same thing. In this case
almost all blue bars hang down from the unit coordinate, indicating
that the weights need re-adjusting (REFINEMENT/WEIGHTS). 

<p> 
CRYSTALS can try to determine a weighting scheme for you.
<br> For refinement against F<sup>2</sup> a scheme similar to 
Sheldrick's scheme is avaiable.
<br>For refinement againts Fo an optimal Chebychev polynomial is fitted 
to the residual.
<br>
When the weights have been correclty assigned, the weighted residual
for any batch of reflections should be about unity.
</p>


<br>The second 
image shows the result of recomputing the weights.  One strong and 
one weak batch still have large blue deviations, but the green curve 
shows that only a few reflections are involved in these batches.

<h4>Class/Parity (index, R-factor, R by class etc)</h4>
<p>
These are diagnostics which may point to problems with the data 
or model in difficult cases. <i>Residual</i> and <i>R</i> 
by parity/class should be constant across the calsses. 
If there is alternation or some other pattern, this may indicate
pseudo-translational symmetry. Examine the SIR ouput file for
an alternative diagnostic. The Residual and R by index should also
be contant. <br>
In this example, the blue bars are consistantly below unity (but
otherwise fairly constant) indicating that the weights need rescaling.

<h3> Agreement</h3>
<p>
The green line is unit gradient.  The reflections (red crosses) should
be distributed evenly about this line. Blue crosses are reflection
that have been filtered out (LIST 28).  If the red crosses follow
a systematic downwards curve at high values of Fc, this may indicate 
the need for an extinction correction. A few point falling a long way 
from the line may be outliers (bad values of Fo), or may indicate
serious erroes in the model (bad values of Fc).  They can be filtered 
out of the refinement by right clicking on them, but only if you are
confident that you can explain them. A slight systematic trend for Fo 
to be greater than Fc, plus more scatter than usual, may indicate 
twinning.<br>
The blue crosses at Fc=zero are reflections that have been filtered out
from the very start. Go to Refinement-Filter Reflections and uncheck the 
filters if you want to compute all Fc values.

<h3> Normal Probability Plot</h3>
<p>
This should be a straight line of unit gradient.  The tails
are often ragged, and not too important if only a few reflections
are involved.  If the line has a significan curve, this means that
there is a significant
trend in the residual which must be corrected either by improving
the model or adjusting the weights. If the curve is more-or-less 
straight but not of unit gradient, the weights need rescalling.
<br> In this case there is a down turn in a few reflections (probably
not too important), and the gradient is about 0.4, indicating that 
the weights need re-scalling.

<h3> Absolute Configuration</h3>

<p>
CRYSTALS has two different refineable parameters to help with the 
determination of absolute structure. <br>
The oldest, the Rodger's "eta" parameter is a multiplier onto f", and 
takes the value +1 if the model has the correct hand, and -1 if it needs 
inverting. Flack showed that this parameter is unreliable as eta 
approaches zero.<br>
The Flack "x" parameter is the mixing term in 
<br> F^2 = (1-x)F^2+h + xF^2-h <br>
and takes the value zero if the model has the correct hand, and +1 if it needs 
inverting.  <br>
Either the Rodger's or Flack parameter should be refined simultaneously 
with the other structural parameters since its value will influence 
them, and they in turn will influence the s.u. on the absolute 
configuration parameter.<br>
<strong> Interpreting the Absolure Configuration Paramters</strong><br>
<p style="font-size:80%">
If the s.u. on the Flack parameter is greater than 0.30, the X-ray data 
contain no significant anomalous information so that the absolute configuration
cannot be assigned by X-ray means. The value of x can be set to zero and not refined.
 (It may be appropriate to report x and its s.u. to demonstrate that the 
calculation was actually performed).  <br>
If the s.u. is small enough (<0.04), then the parameter itself can be evaluated.  
If it falls close to zero or unity, then the absolute configuration has been determined.
If it falls within this range, but is significantly distant from the bounds, 
the material is probably twinned by inversion.
</p>
<p style="font-size:100%">
Hooft, Straver and Spek have devised a new parameter which examines the 
anomalous differences computed with the Flack x set to zero.  Its 
robustness has yet to be determined.

<h3> Difabs</h3>
<p>
The colour-field shows the mean value &lt;Fo/Fc&gt; value as a funcion of 
the azimuthal and declination angles, i.e. as a funcion of direction 
with respect to the crystal shape.  It should be featureless, but 
almost never is.  Steep gradients may indicate problems with the 
structural model or with the data processing (e.g. unsatisfactory 
absorption corrections). The text window shows the maximum, minimum and 
mean values, which in  this case range over +/- 5% and are not very 
significant. (Note that the DIFABS calculation can actually be applied 
in CRYSTALS as a "correction" to the data, but this is not available 
from a menu.)

<h3> Rotax</h3>

<h3> MOGUL</h3>
<p>
This can only be used if you have the CCDC MOGUL system installed on 
your PC.  It compares the local geometry of your structure with similar 
geometries in the MOGUL data base and alerts you to any significant 
differences (\Z\ values).  Clicking on a featue shows the corresponding 
values stored in MOGUL.  It can be used to set up restraints, where the 
target values and esds are based on the MOGUL values.

<h3> Highlighted atoms + TLS</h3>
<p>
Computes the TLS analysis of the selected atoms.  Large values of R1 
indicate thet the selected atoms do not form a rigid group.  Small 
values of R1 plus large values of L<sub>33</sub> indicate thet there may 
be a bond shortening effect.  Look in the listing file to see the 
corrected bond lengths.  In this case the R1 value of 7% and the 
 L<sub>33</sub> value of 70 degree<sup>2</sup> leads to bond length 
corrections of about 0.02A.

<h3> Highlighted atoms + Slant Fourier</h3>
<p>
This computes the best plane through the selected atoms and then the 
electron density (or difference density) in sections parallel to the 
plane. You will probably need to raise the number of sections from the 
default (2) in order to obtain a thicker slab of the structure.  Michael 
Husaks MCE viewer lets you examine the density. <br>
This is a really useful utiity for helping you to unravel disorder.  
Remember that an ordinary peak-search picks out local maxima, but tells 
you nothing about the surrounding density. Set the occupation factors of
the suspicious atoms to zero and then re-compute structure factors 
(<b>Do not try refinement</b>). Then click the solvent atoms to locate 
the area of interest and view the slant difference Fourier. The atoms 
with zero occupancie will not contribute to the map, but will help you
locate the supposed solvent amongst the electron density.<br><br>

CRYSTALS by courtesy of Micheal Husak and Jan Rohlicek.
