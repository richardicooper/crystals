        <p>Plots &lt;(Fo-Fc)<sup>2</sup>&gt; vs Fc and resolution (red) and
        &lt;w(Fo-Fc)<sup>2</sup>&gt; vs Fc and resolution (blue). The blue bars should
        all be very short and centred at about 1.0. In this example there is a systematic
        trend as a function of both Fc and resolution. Since high angle reflections are
        generally weak, these two curves are saying more or less the same thing. In this
        case almost all blue bars hang down from the unit coordinate, indicating that the
        weights need re-adjusting (REFINEMENT/WEIGHTS).</p>

        <p>CRYSTALS can try to determine a weighting scheme for you.<br />
        For refinement against F<sup>2</sup> a scheme similar to Sheldrick's scheme is
        avaiable.<br />
        For refinement againts Fo an optimal Chebychev polynomial is fitted to the
        residual.<br />
        When the weights have been correclty assigned, the weighted residual for any
        batch of reflections should be about unity.</p><br />
        The second image shows the result of recomputing the weights. One strong and one
        weak batch still have large blue deviations, but the green curve shows that only
        a few reflections are involved in these batches.

        indicate pseudo-translational symmetry. Examine the SIR ouput file for an
        alternative diagnostic. The Residual and R by index should also be contant.<br />
        In this example, the blue bars are consistantly below unity (but otherwise fairly
        constant) indicating that the weights need rescaling.</p>

        <h3>Fo vs Fc</h3>

        <p>The green line is unit gradient. The reflections (red crosses) should be
        distributed evenly about this line. Blue crosses are reflection that have been
        filtered out (LIST 28). If the red crosses follow a systematic downwards curve at
        high values of Fc, this may indicate the need for an extinction correction. A few
        point falling a long way from the line may be outliers (bad values of Fo), or may
        indicate serious erroes in the model (bad values of Fc). They can be filtered out
        of the refinement by right clicking on them, but only if you are confident that
        you can explain them. A slight systematic trend for Fo to be greater than Fc,
        plus more scatter than usual, may indicate twinning.<br />
        The blue crosses at Fc=zero are reflections that have been filtered out from the
        very start. Go to Refinement-Filter Reflections and uncheck the filters if you
        want to compute all Fc values.</p>

        <h3>Normal Probability Plot</h3>

        <p>This should be a straight line of unit gradient. The tails are often ragged,
        and not too important if only a few reflections are involved. If the line has a
        significan curve, this means that there is a significant trend in the residual
        which must be corrected either by improving the model or adjusting the weights.
        If the curve is more-or-less straight but not of unit gradient, the weights need
        rescalling.<br />
        In this case there is a down turn in a few reflections (probably not too
        important), and the gradient is about 0.4, suggesting that the weights need
        re-scalling.</p>

        <h3>Difabs Structure Residuals</h3>

        <p>The colour-field shows the mean value &lt;Fo/Fc&gt; value as a funcion of
        azimuth and declination of the incident and emergent beams, i.e. as a funcion of
        direction with respect to the crystal shape.<br />
        <br />
        For Area Detector data, multiple observations at different angles are merged, so
        the azimuth (angle in the h-k plane) and declination (angle above this plane) of
        the scattering vector are used.<br />
        <br />
        The map should be featureless, but almost never is. Steep gradients may indicate
        problems with the structural model or with the data processing (e.g.
        unsatisfactory absorption corrections). The text window shows the maximum,
        minimum and mean values, which in this case range over +/- 5% and are not very
        significant. (Note that the DIFABS calculation can actually be applied in
        CRYSTALS as a "correction" to the data, but this is not available from a
        menu.)<br />
        <br />
        If the figure field is completely black (very little variation) more detail can
        sometimes be seen by plotting the logarithm of the values (Press L on the
        keyboard).<br />
        Pressing / replaces the ratio map with the multiplicity of observation map. This
        should show good coverage of the unique part of the reciprocal lattice.</p>

        <p>This shows the usual ripple due to repeated molecular motifs. The gradient
        gives an estimate of the overall adp, the intercept an estimate of the overall

        Low values of <b>MOD[E<sup>2</sup>-1]</b> (&lt; 0.74) may indicate
        twinning.<br />
        If the high-rho end of the curve is ragged, or shows an up-turn (due to
        systematic over-estimation of weak reflections), a maximum value of rho for the
        rest of the analysis can be selected by right-clicking on the appropriate blue
        cross. This value can be reset at any time in the REFINEMENT/FILTERING menu. The

        <h3>Internal vs External Variances</h3>

        <p>The Internal variance is the rms value of equivalent reflections, i.e. a
        measure of the self consistency. The External variance is the weighted average of
        the variances in the input file, i.e. the instrument makers estimated standard
        uncertainty. If the gradient of the plot differs greatly from unity there may be
        something wrong with the data processing.<br />
        The red points have a low multiplicity (less than 6).<br />

        <h3>Weight vs Sigma</h3>

        <p>The weights used in linear least-squares refinement should be the inverse of
        the observed variance for Normally distributed errors. For non-linear least
        squares the weights have to take into account errors in the model (equivalent to
        unetected systematic errors in the data) and non-random errors in the data. It is
        now common practice to augment the variances with term dependent upon the
        mangnitude of the observation, (see, for example, <i>X-ray Analyses and the
        Structure of Organic Molecules, J.D.Dunitz,Cornel, 1979, page 217</i> or <i>G.
        Bernardinelli AND H. D. FlacK, Acta Cryst. (1987). A43, 75-78</i> where the
        augmentation is called a 'Stability Constant'). The SHELX weighting scheme now
        commonly used for F<sup>2</sup> tries to determine this (and a higher order
        parameter) automatically. Because the variances of modern data are very small,
        the weights of all but the weakest reflections are almost entirely derived from
        these empirical parameters<br />
        <br />
        Note, in the plot, that very few refelctions lie on the unit gradient line. The
        SHELX parameters were 0.048 and 2.54</p>

        <p>CRYSTALS has two different refineable parameters to help with the
        determination of absolute structure.<br />
        The oldest, the Rodger's "eta" parameter is a multiplier onto f", and takes the
        value +1 if the model has the correct hand, and -1 if it needs inverting. Flack
        showed that this parameter is unreliable as eta approaches zero.<br />
        <strong>Direct Refinement</strong><br />
        The Flack "x" parameter is the mixing term in<br />
        F<sup>2</sup> = (1-x)F<sup>2</sup>+h + x<sup>2</sup>-h<br />
        and takes the value zero if the model has the correct hand, and +1 if it needs
        inverting.<br />
        Either the Rodger's or Flack parameter should be refined simultaneously with the
        other structural parameters since its value will influence them, and they in turn
        will influence the s.u. on the absolute configuration parameter.<br />
        <strong>Post-refinement Methods</strong> Post-refinement methods analyse the
        Bijvoet differences. Usually they produce more-or-less that same value for the
        Flack parameter as direct refinement, but often with a much reduced esd. It has
        been shown that the larger esd for direct refinement can usually be attributed to
        the weighting scheme used during refinement, which is usually chosen to reflect
        short comings in both the data and the model. <i>Watkin and Cooper, Acta Cryst.
        (2016). B72, 661&ndash;683</i>. The Parsons(q), Hooft(y) and Bijvoet(d)
        parameters and esds are generally very similar, and are the most reliable
        estimators of absolute structure currently available.<br />
        The Hooft, Straver and Spek Probability parameters are robust if the material is
        known to be enantio pure. <i>Hooft, Straver, &amp; Spek, (2008). J. Appl. Cryst.
        41, 96&ndash;103.</i><br />
        <br />
        <strong>Interpreting the Absolute Configuration Parameters</strong><br />
        The interpretation is equally applicable to direct and post-refinement
        methods.</p>

        <p style="font-size:80%">If the s.u. on the Flack parameter is greater than 0.30,
        the X-ray data contain no significant anomalous information so that the absolute
        configuration cannot be assigned by X-ray means. The value of x can be set to
        zero and not refined. (It may be appropriate to report x and its s.u. to
        demonstrate that the calculation was actually performed).<br />
        If the s.u. is small enough (&lt;0.04), then the parameter itself can be
        evaluated. If it falls close to zero or unity, then the absolute configuration
        has been determined. If it falls within this range, but is significantly distant
        from the bounds, the material is probably twinned by inversion.</p>

        <h3>MOGUL Analysis</h3>

        <p>If CCDC <i>MOGUL</i> is installed, the local geometry (bonds and/or angles) of
        the structure can be compared with average values stored in the MOGUL data base.
        The magnitude of any discrepancy is relected in a <i>Z</i> value, the smaller Z
        the better.<br />
        Features selected from the list are high lighted, and the MOGUL values can be
        used to construct restraints.</p>

        <h3>Highlighted atoms + TLS</h3>

        <p>Computes the TLS analysis of the selected atoms. Large values of R1 indicate
        thet the selected atoms do not form a rigid group. Small values of R1 plus large
        values of L<sub>33</sub> indicate thet there may be a bond shortening effect.
        Look in the listing file to see the corrected bond lengths. In this case the R1
        value of 7% and the L<sub>33</sub> value of 70 degree<sup>2</sup> leads to bond
        length corrections of about 0.02A.</p>

        <h3>Highlighted atoms + Slant Fourier</h3>

        <p>This computes the best plane through the selected atoms and then the electron
        density (or difference density) in sections parallel to the plane. You will
        probably need to raise the number of sections from the default (2) in order to
        obtain a thicker slab of the structure. Michael Husaks MCE viewer lets you
        examine the density.<br />
        This is a really useful utiity for helping you to unravel disorder. Remember that
        an ordinary peak-search picks out local maxima, but tells you nothing about the
        surrounding density. Set the occupation factors of the suspicious atoms to zero
        and then re-compute structure factors (<b>Do not try refinement</b>). Then click
        the solvent atoms to locate the area of interest and view the slant difference
        Fourier. The atoms with zero occupancie will not contribute to the map, but will
        help you locate the supposed solvent amongst the electron density.<br />
