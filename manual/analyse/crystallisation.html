  <h1>Crystallisation from a solution containing R and S molecules</h1>
  </div>
  <h2>Case 1.</h2>The molecules associate in pairs across a symmetry operator of the
  second kind e.g. a centre of inversion, mirror.<br />
  The space group will be achiral and can be either centrosymmetric (e.g. P21/c) or
  non-centrosymmetric (e.g. Pc).<br />
  The crystal will contain equal numbers of the R and S molecules<br />
  A solution made from an achiral crystal will not rotate polarised light.<br />

  <h2>Case 2.</h2>The molecules segregate themselves, with each crystal containing
  exclusively R or S molecules. This is called spontaneous resolution, and the resulting
  mixture of crystals is called a conglomerate. Both hands of crystals in Pasteur&rsquo;s
  resolved tartrate were in space group P21 21 2<br />
  The space group will be chiral non-centrosymmetric, e.g. P21 21 21. The space group of
  a crystal containing only R molecules will almost always be the same as that containing
  only S molecules.<br />
  The specific rotation of a solution made from a crystal containing R molecules will be
  equal and opposite to that made from a crystal containing S molecules<br />

  <h2>Case 3.</h2>The crystals contain regions consisting exclusively of R molecules, and
  regions consisting exclusively of S molecules. These regions will have an exact
  crystallographic relationship with each other, but need not necessarily be of the same
  volume. The crystal is said to be twinned by inversion, often called racemic
  twinning.<br />
  The space group will be chiral non-centrosymmetric, e.g. P21 21 21.<br />
  The specific rotation of a solution made from a single crystal will be less than that
  from an un-twinned crystal.<br />
