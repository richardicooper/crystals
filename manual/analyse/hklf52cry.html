  Twinned crystals are ones in which two (or more) parts have different
  orientations. Unlike accidental intergrowths, the unit cells of the components of a
  twin are related to each other in a rational way, so that the indices of reflections
  from each component are also rationally related by a matrix call the "Twin Law". Each
  part generates its own diffraction pattern. These will also have a rtional relationship
  between them.<br />

  <p><strong>Classification</strong></p>

  <p>Early classifications were made on the basis of morphology, measured with contact or
  optical goniometers. The fine details of this scheme and the nomenclature, though
  useful for describing individual twins, are probably not useful for structure analysts.
  Classification based on the reciprocal lattice are simpler. Note that there is a rather
  inconsistent use of classification schemes in the literature. A fundamental division
  for the structure analyst is the distinction between twins in which every observable
  reciprocal lattice point contains contributions from both twin components, and those
  twins in which some points contain contributions from one component only.</p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>TLQS twins</strong> have multiple diffraction patters. The
    &lsquo;spots&rsquo; may be split, or give two distinct lattices.</li>

    <td width="50%">
    In the central (horizontal) row the diffraction spots from two lattices 
    overlap exactly. In the first row above, the two lattices give rise to 
    separate diffaction spots (white arrows for one lattice, blue for the other).
    On the next row the spots are (in this example) almost evenly spaced.
    By the 4<sup>th</sup> row the spots are again overlapping. <br>
    TLQS twins are normally evident from the diffraction images. The instument
    must decide how to process the images. 
    <br />
    In this case the intensities of 
    reflections on the zeroth and fourth rows are the sums of both lattices.
    On the first and second rows the two components are well resolved and can be
    estimated separately. On the third row the splitting is marginal, and the instrument
    will have to choose for itself whether to agregate the contributions, or whether it
    can resolve them.

        The twin operator belongs to the Laue symmetry of the untwinned crystal. The

   i and ii represent the diffraction patterns from each of two components (each with
   symmetry <i>2</i>) related
   by a 2-fold rotations about <i>h</i>. If there are equal volumes of both component
   in the twin, the resulting image is as in iii.  The diffraction image now has <i>mm</i>
   symmetry, which could lead to difficulties in determining the space group. If the volumes
   are unequal, the symmetry remains <i>2</i>. Note that in 3 there are more strong spots in
   i and ii.  This gives rise to an unusual distribution of E values 
   (&lt;|E<sup>2</sup>-1|&gt;&nbsp;~0.74) and several values of F<sub>o</sub>
   substantially greater than F<sub>c</sub>.

      CRYSTALS and SHELXL both refine composite crystals (usually twins) by the
      method of C. T. Grainger and J. F. McConnell. ( <i>Acta Cryst. (1969). B25,
      1962</i>). In the absence of interference between the diffracted beams from each
      component of the twin, the observed intensity is the volume-fraction weighted sum
      of the overlapping intensities from the twin components.<br />
      Io=&Sigma;c<sub>i</sub>I<sub>i</sub><br />
      where c<sub>i</sub> is the vol-fraction of component <i>i</i>, and I<sub>i</sub>
      its unobservable intensity. The c<sub>i</sub> can be estimated by replacing the
      observed I<sub>i</sub> with their calculated equivalents. The c<sub>i</sub> should
      sum to unity.<br />

        <h2>Experimental Considerations</h2></div>
      </div>The diffraction image for a sample consisting of two parts will consist of
      overlapping diffraction patterns from each component. The instrument software will
      have to try to assign each diffracted spot to one lattice or the other, or both
      simultaneously, and hence assign one or two indices to each spot. Each lattice will
      have its own orientation matrix.<br />
      If the sample is really twinned, there will be a geometric relationship between the
      orientation of the two patterns in three dimensions. This relationship is the Twin
      Law, and must be determined when the diffraction images are being processed.<br />
      If the sample is not really twinned, but is just two crystallites grown together,
      the instrument may still be able to assign orientation matrices to the two
      lattices, but they will not be related in a rational way.<br />
      The output reflection file will consist of a list of the observed intensities
      together with information about the indices of the reflections contributing to the
      total intensity. CRYSTALS and SHELX use different ways of representing this
      relationship.

      <div class="c1">
        <h2>Differences between CRYSTALS and SHELXL</h2>
      </div>

      <h3>CRYSTALS</h3>The crystal is regarded as being composed of a principal and a
      minor component. The reflection file consists of the index of the principal
      component, the total measured intensity, and a flag indicating whether the minor
      component also contributes to the intensity.
      <pre>
e.g.
h k l intensity sigma 1
</pre>indicates a contribution from only the primary component
      <pre>
h k l intensity sigma 12
</pre>indicates a contribution from both components. The index of the second component
(which is needed in order to determine its calculated intensity) is obtained by
multiplying the given index by the twin law matrix. The concept can be extended to a
sample consisting of up to nine components.

      <h3>SHELX</h3>Twinned data is input into SHELXL by the instruction:<br />
      hklf 5<br />
      The reflection file consists of groups of lines all referring to a single observed
      intensity.
      <pre>
e.g.
h k l intensity sigma m
</pre>hkl is the index corresponding to component <i>m</i>.<br />
      When both twin components contribute to a single observed intensity they are
      grouped together:
      <pre>
h  k  l  intensity sigma -1
h' k' l' intensity sigma  2
</pre>The intensity and sigmas have the same values on both lines. hkl is the index of
the principal component, h'k'l' the index of the minor component, indicated by the <i>
      2</i> at the end of the line.<br />
      Since the index of the minor component is given explicitly, SHELX does not need to
      know the twin law, and in fact the two components neesd not be related by a twin
      law.<br />
