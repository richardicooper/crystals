CRYSTALS and SHELXL both refine composite crystals (usually twins)
by the method of C. T. Grainger and J. F. McConnell. (<i> Acta Cryst. (1969). B25, 
1962</i>).  In the absence of interference between the diffracted beams from each
component of the twin, the observed intensity is the volume-fraction weighted sum of the
overlapping intensities from the twin components.<br>
Io=&Sigma;c<sub>i</sub>I<sub>i</sub><br>
where c<sub>i</sub> is the vol-fraction of component <i>i</i>, and I<sub>i</sub> its 
unobservable intensity.  The c<sub>i</sub> can be estimated by replacing the observed 
I<sub>i</sub> with their calculated equivalents.  The c<sub>i</sub> should sum to unity.
<br>
Unlike accidental intergrowths, the unit cells of the components of a twin are related
to each other in a rational way, so that the indices of reflections from each component
are also rationally related by a matrix call the "Twin Law".<br>


<center><h2>Experimental Considerations</h2></center>

The diffraction image for a sample consisting of two parts will consist of overlapping 
diffraction patterns from each component. 
The instrument software will have to try to assign each diffracted spot to one lattice or 
the other, or both simultaneously,  and hence assign one or two indices to each spot.  
Each lattice will have its own orientation matrix.
<br>
If the sample is really twinned, there will be  
a geometric relationship between the orientation of the two patterns in three dimensions.
This relationship is the Twin Law, and  must be determined when the diffraction images 
are being processed.

<br>
If the sample is not really twinned, but is just two crystallites grown together, the 
instrument may still be able to assign orientation matrices to the two lattices, but they 
will not be related in a rational way.
<br>
The output reflection file will consist of a list of the observed intensities together 
with information about the indices of the reflections contributing to the total intensity.
CRYSTALS and SHELX use different ways of representing this relationship.

<center><h2>Differences between CRYSTALS and SHELXL</h2></center>

<h3>CRYSTALS</h3>
The crystal is regarded as being composed of a principal and a minor component. The 
reflection file consists of the index of the principal component, the total measured 
intensity, and a flag indicating whether the minor component also contributes to the 
intensity.

<pre>
e.g.
h k l intensity sigma 1
</pre>
indicates a contribution from only the primary component
<pre>
h k l intensity sigma 12
</pre>
indicates a contribution from both components. The index of the second component (which is 
needed in order to determine its calculated intensity) is obtained by multiplying the 
given index by the twin law matrix.  The concept can be extended to a sample 
consisting of up to nine components.
<h3>SHELX</h3>
Twinned data is input into SHELXL by the instruction:<br>
hklf 5<br>
The reflection file consists of groups of lines all referring to a single observed 
intensity. 
<pre>
e.g.
h k l intensity sigma m
</pre>
hkl is the index corresponding to component <i>m</i>.<br>
When both twin components contribute to a single observed intensity they are grouped 
together:
<pre>
h  k  l  intensity sigma -1
h' k' l' intensity sigma  2
</pre>
The intensity and sigmas have the same values on both lines. hkl is the index of the 
principal component, h'k'l' the index of the minor component, indicated by the <i>2</i> at 
the end of the line.<br>
Since the index of the minor component is given explicitly, SHELX does not need to know 
the twin law, and in fact the two components neesd not be related by a twin law.
