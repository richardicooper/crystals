<h2> Environment Variables</h2>
<p>
The executable is accompanied by a small file, <b>check.def</b>, which 
contains the definitions of the various checks.  It is usually in the 
same folder as the executable. PLATON will look for this file using the 
"environment variable" CHECKDEF.

<h2> Moving PLATON</h2>
The first time you run PLATON, CRYSTALS invites you to browse to find 
the executable.  After that, the location is stored in the Registry.  If 
you move PLATON to a different location, you will have to browse for it 
again.
