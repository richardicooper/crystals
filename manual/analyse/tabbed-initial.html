        <h4>Completeness</h4>

        <p>An almost solid row of green crosses at the top - good sign - high
        completeness.<br />
        Missing Data: A few low angle reflections missing (probably behind the beam
        stop)- Not usually important unless you propose to use SQUEEZE. 
        If the green crosses fall off at high angle, you can
        click on the graph at the theta max at which you believe the data to be
        more-or-less complete.<br />
        The inset shows data from a <a href="./cropped.jpg">poorly diffracting
        poly-peptide</a>. The structure was difficult to solve, and refined to a
        conventional R=8% with data down to 2 &sigma;.<br />

        The bottom figure is from a data set measured to a very high resolution, requiring
        two different detector theta setings. Note the &apos;hole&apos; where the two 
        settings don't quite overlap.<br />

        <h4>Sigma Frequency</h4>

        <p>There are very few reflections below -2 &sigma; - i.e. no badly negative
        reflections. From the blue line you can see that about 5400 out of the 7000
        reflections have I/&sigma;(I) &amp;GT; 3. The listing file should give the exact
        figure. 77% of this data is reliably observable. If the figure falls below 50%
        you can expect problems with structure solution and refinement.</p>

        <h4>Sigma vs Resolution</h4>

        <p>The dark blue curve shows that there is a roughly constant amount of
        very reliable data throughout the
        [sin(theta)/lambda]<sup>3</sup>. As normal, the weak data (red) is
        mostly at high resolution. The pale blue curve is the cumulative sum, and is scaled
        to fit the chart (right hand scale). Note that it slowly falls away until a
        [sin(theta)/lambda]<sup>3</sup> of about 1.0, when it suddenl;y rises
        before falling away again. This is the point where the time-per-frame
        was increased.<br />
        The inset shows the data for a poor crystal.  The frequency of good strong 
        reflections falls away with resolution (dark blue curve). The mean I/sig(I)
        falls away rapidly.<br />

        <h4>Merging R factor</h4>
        <p>The red histogram shows the Merging R-factor as a function of population 
        data quality (<i>I/sig(I)</i>). Note that this data set has a quite well defined
        upper limit (See Diederichs, K. (2010). Acta Cryst. D66, 733–740.).<br />

        The green curve is the number of reflections classed by the intensity and standard
        uncertainty of the mean.

        <h4>Systematic Absences</h4>
        <p>If the systematic absences were measured in the same way as the rest of the 
        data, they throw light on the quality of the accidentally weak reflections.<br />
        The systematicaly absent reflections will not be exactly zero because of random
        noise, but their average value shold be zero. The distribution of refections in the 
        upper right and lower left quadrants should be similar.  An excess in the upper
        right might imply that the weak reflections are being over-estimated, that the 
        crystal is twinned or that there is substantial &lambda;/2 contamination.

        <h4>Absences Histogram</h4>
        <p>In the upper plot, the red histogram shows the number of systemaitic absences
        in each interval of Fo. (note that the scale is quadratic).  The green line is the
        mean intensity in each bin.<br />
        The lower plot shows the signal to noise distribution F/&sigma;(F).

        <h4>Wilson Plot</h4>

        <p>This shows the usual ripple due to repeated molecular motifs. The gradient
        gives an estimate of the overall adp, the intercept an estimate of the overall
        scale of the data. Note the conventional use of <b>B</b> for the adp.<br />
        B=8.pi<sup>2</sup>U<br />
        Low values of <b>MOD[E<sup>2</sup>-1]</b> (&lt; 0.74) may indicate
        twinning.<br />
        If the high-rho end of the curve is ragged, or shows an up-turn (due to
        systematic over-estimation of weak reflections), a maximum value of rho for the
        rest of the analysis can be selected by right-clicking on the appropriate blue
        cross. This value can be reset at any time in the REFINEMENT/FILTERING menu. The
        LIST 28 check box enables you so see the effect of reflection filters.<br />
