<center><h1>Dealing with Difficult Structures.</h1></center>
<p>
If you cannot solve a structure to get an approximate model, CRYSTALS
can offer only limited help. 
CRYSTALS has no in-built structure solution routines - we depend 
entirely upon programs such as SIR, Superflip and SHELXS to get an 
approximate starting model.</p>
Sometimes a structure will solve, but be difficult to refine.
<p>
We can define a 'difficult structure' as one which solves but
does not easily (or 
even at all) satisfy the checkCIF requirements.  Symptoms of a difficult 
structure include</p>

<ol>
<li>Conventional R-factor unexpectedly high</li>
<li>Unusual/unreasonable bond lengths or angles</li>
<li>Unreasonable adps</li>
<li>Poor observation:parameter ratio</li>
<li>Failure to converge</li>
</ol>

<br>     
There is no universal recipe for resolving difficult structures. The 
following information comes from a data set we were asked to look at 
because the original worker was having problems.  Only the metals were 
being refined anisotropically.  Full aniso refinement 'blew up' 
(R-factor increased, adps became unrealistic, atoms moved to non-bonded 
positions).
<br>There are two molecules in the asymmetric unit including 5 
perfluorophenyl groups between them, plus 17 carbonyl groups.

<h2> Fo vs Fc plot</h2><br>
Note the very large numbers of reflections omitted by the 2-sigma
cut off. Note also the dozen or so reflections having a very small
Fo value, but large Fc values.   These outliers have been excluded
manually.  However, if Friedel pairs are not merged, it is seen
that both reflections are outliers, indicating something
systematically wrong with either the data or the model.

<h2> Completeness</h2><br>
The curve is visibly ragged towards the high angle end.  In fact,
the situation is much worse than it seems because most of the
high angle reflections which are present in the hkli file are
worthless.  See the Wilson plot.

<h2> Wilson Plot plot</h2><br>
The Wilson plot has a negative gradient, indicating a negative
overall atomic displacement parameter - which is physically impossible.
This effect is characteristic of a very large number of
missing high angle reflections. Selecting a reflection filter at about
rho = (sin(theta)/lambda)^2 = 0.22 will cut out much of the faulty data.
<br>
Note that a poor Wilson plot may prevent SIR from finding a structure 
(or even cause it to crash).  Edit the SIR input file and remove the
comment character (&gt;) from the line<i> &gt;  rhomax 0.33 </i>
and set the maximum value you want to use.

<h3>Systematic Absences</h3>
As the reflections are read in to CRYSTALS, the systematic absences are
identified, statistics accumulated about them, and then they are 
eliminated.
<br>
This information appears on the screen, but is also saved in the listing 
file.  In this example the rms Fo/sigma(Fo) for the unobserved data is
1.8 - i.e. the unobserved data is being over-estimated.

<h3>Merging Equivalent Reflections</h3><br>
Note that only 13% of the data is observed at 3 sigma(I) - the analysis 
will certainly be difficult.<br>
Note also that Rint for the strong data is 0.051 - there is fair 
self-consistency amongst the properly observed data.  However, the 
overall Rint is very poor, and the very weak reflections are not 
self-consistent.

beyond this limit, but mixed in with a lot of rubbish.

<h2> Twinning</h2><br>
One cause of a refinement failing to progress is unidentified twinning.
The utility ROTAX examines the residuals F0-Fc to see if they can be 
accounted for by twinning by rotation. Choose the drop doen menu
<i>Analyse</i> and <i>Rotax</i>.  In this case no evidence was found for 
twinning.

<h2> Rescuing the Structure</h2><br>
This data was collected on a conventional CCD instrument with Mo
radiation at room temperature from a crystal measuring 
0.1 * 0.07 * 0.025 mm.  The crystal was then lost and there is no more 
material.  Chemically the material is very interesting, with one of the 
two molecules having a C=O group replaced by a C<sub>6</sub>F<sub>5</sub> group - i.e. not 
quite a Z'=2 structure.  Careful examination of Fourier and Fourier 
Difference maps virtually rules out the possibility that the gross 
connectivity is wrong.  <br>
Unless more material can be synthesised (not the job of the 
crystallographer) the best plan would be to refine the material
with chemically sensible restraints.  There are 5 C<sub>6</sub>F<sub>5</sub> groups, which 
could all be restrained to be similar, and 17 C=O groups which also 
should be similar.  <br>
Setting up the restraints one-by-one would be very tedious, but the 
RESIDUE and PART utilities can help.

<td width="40%">
<h2> Residues</h2><br>
Residues are used to associate together the atoms in discrete molecules. 
RESIDUE numbers can be inserted by hand using #EDIT, by editing the 
parameter list below the image, or from the drop-down menu under 
<i>Structure</i>. An atom with a RESIDUE number of zero means that the atom 
has 
not been allocated to a residue. Clicking <i>Allocate Residue Number</i>
causes CRYSTALS to look through the atom list.  If any atom is already 
in a residue, any other atom bonded to it and with a RESIDUE number of 
zero is allocated the same RESIDUE number as the atom it is bonded to.
<br>
If all of the RESIDUE numbers are zero, CRYSTALS allocates a unique 
RESIDUE number to all the atoms making up each discrete 'molecule'.  
Using the <i>Bond Type</i> tool in the graphics window, bonds can be 
removed so that a single molecule can be broken into molecular fragments.

END

#EDIT
# get the atoms into a tidy order

Residues can now be referenced directly in most CRYSTALS commands:
e.g.
#LIST 12
BLOCK SCALE RESIDUE(1,X'S,U[ISO]) RESIDUE(2,X'S,U'S)
END
#CHECK

<h2> Parts</h2><br>
PARTS give the user even finer access to groups of atoms. Normally
they are used to control bonding and simplify the treatment of 
disordered fragments. 
<br>
They can also be used to single out molecular fragments for special
treatment.
<br>
PART numbers can be allocated manually via #EDIT, via the parameter pane 
beneath the model viewer, or via the dropdown menu <i>Structure</i> and 
<i>Allocate Part Nos</i>.
<br>
A PART identifier is built from two components: 
<strong>ASSEMBLY</strong> and <strong>GROUP</strong>. <br>
A GROUP number is allocated to a list of atoms that are to be treated
together, and will appear connected by bonds.<br>
An ASSEMBLY is a collection of GROUPS that can be processed 
together.<br>
These two components are combined:<br>
PART = 1000*ASSEMBLY + GROUP

<h2> Parts</h2><br>
In addition to dealing with disorder, PARTS can be used to simplify the 
treatment of difficult refinements, in particular, the application of 
restraints.<br>
In this example, we could expect the five C<sub>6</sub>F<sub>5</sub> groups to have similar 
bond lengths and angles, and for the adps within each residue to be 
related.<br>
For the C<sub>6</sub>F<sub>5</sub> groups, use the <i>Structure</i> and <i>Allocate Part Nos</i>.
menus.
<br>
 Put all the C<sub>6</sub>F<sub>5</sub> moieties into a single RESIDUE, and put all the 
atoms of each moiety into a single GROUP. The parameter window will show 
the RESIDUE and GROUP numbers.
<br>
There is little to be gained by allocating PART numbers to the carbonyl 
groups.

<h2> Setting up Restraints</h2><br>
We verified above that the data in this example is of very low quality. 
It cannot be re-collected, but the structure is chemically interesting. 
We have to make the best of it that we can.<br>
One acceptable strategy is to feed chemical and physical knowledge into 
the calculation.  
<br>This can be done by making rigid groups of atoms conform to a
standard geometry and then refining them as rigid groups.
<br>
It can also be easily done by adding restraints. The advantage of 
restraints over constraints is that the additional information is 
introduced with a measure of ones confidence in it.
For simple cases CRYSTALS can set up some restraints for you.  In this 
example, it must be done manually.<br>
The physical knowledge we might want to introduce is:
<br>
<ul>
<li>
All the C-C bonds in the C<sub>6</sub>F<sub>5</sub> groups will be 
equal at the resolution of this data, as will all the C-F bonds.
<li>
The amplitude of vibration of the atoms at each end of a bond will be 
similar (the Hirshfeld condition).
<li>
The isotropic adps of adjacent atoms will be similar
<li>
The Ru-C-O bonds will be co-linear
</ul>
