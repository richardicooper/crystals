  <h3>Determination of Absolute Structure for all-light atom materials using Mo radiation
  is usually problematic. CRYSTALS offers a variety of tools. Consistency amongst the
  results should increase your confidence in the analysis. If there are inconsistencies
  it is likely that there are other problems with the data or the structural model.</h3>

  <p>All materials in a non-centrosymmetric space group will have an absolute
  structure.<br>
  This may arise either because the material is composed of enantiopure chiral molecules
  (eg sucrose) or because achiral entities are arranged into a chiral structure (e.g.
  SiO4 in quartz).<br>
  For non-centrosymmetric achiral materials, the crystal will have one or more polar
  directions which must be correctly assigened if the Polar Axis Dispersion Error is to
  be avoided.<br>
  For non-centrosymmetric chiral crystals, the Absolute Cofiguration of the material can
  be assigned if the absolute structure determination was successful.<br>
  For a quick overview of absolute structurures and configuration, see: <i>Absolute
  Configuration Determination: Is There More Information in the Data?. D.J. Watkin, and
  A.L. Thompson, Acta Cryst., A65, s307 (2009).</i></p>

        <p>CRYSTALS has two different refineable parameters to help with the
        determination of absolute structure.<br>
        The oldest, the Rodger's "eta" parameter is a multiplier onto f", and takes the
        value +1 if the model has the correct hand, and -1 if it needs inverting. Flack
        showed that this parameter is unreliable as eta approaches zero.<br>
        The Flack "x" parameter is the mixing term in<br>
        F<sup>2</sup> = (1-x)F<sup>2</sup>+h + xF<sup>2</sup>-h<br>
        and takes the value zero if the model has the correct hand, and +1 if it needs
        inverting.<br>
        Either the Rodger's or Flack parameter should be refined simultaneously with the
        other structural parameters since its value will influence them, and they in turn
        will influence the s.u. on the absolute configuration parameter.<br>
        <strong>Interpreting the Absolure Configuration Parameters</strong><br></p>

        <p style="font-size:80%">If the s.u. on the Flack parameter is greater than 0.30,
        the X-ray data contain no significant anomalous information so that the absolute
        configuration cannot be assigned by X-ray means. The value of x can be set to
        zero and not refined. (It may be appropriate to report x and its s.u. to
        demonstrate that the calculation was actually performed).<br>
        If the s.u. is small enough (&amp;lt0.04), then the parameter itself can be
        evaluated. If it falls close to zero or unity, then the absolute configuration
        has been determined. If it falls within this range, but is significantly distant
        from the bounds, the material is probably twinned by inversion.</p>

        For a reliable determination, the number of unpaired reflection should be

        The number of Friedel pairs used should be similar to the number found. If many

        The number of reflections used in accumulating the scatterplot should similar to

        the anomalous scattering is very weak. Changing the filters to accept more data

        If the weighted averages of x and y (the plot axes) are far from zero, there may
        be a systematic error in the data or the model<br>
        The larger the rms values, the greater the dispersion of the data. This could
        either be due to a strong anomalous signal, or to a lot of noise. The plot should
        make the choice evident.<br>
        The Roots are the eigenvalues of the scatterplot (Prinicipal Component Analysis).
        For a Do/Dc or Qo/Qc plot them largest root should have an angle (with the
        x-axis) of 45 degrees. The minor root is a measure of the noise. You want a big
        major and a small minor axis. For a Ro/Dc plot the major axis should make a small
        angle with the x-axis. The minor root measures the noise.<br>
        <br>
        For the Do/Dc and Qo/Qc plots the correltaion coefficient and the coefficient of
        determination (R<sup>2</sup>) should be large. Small values mean that the values
        of Do or Qo are not determined by the values of Dc or Qc.<br>
        The slope of the plot should be close to unity, and the intercept close to
        zero.<br>
        The Normal Probability Plot should have a unit gradient. values far from unity
        may mean that the weights for the main Least Squares have not been properly
        determined, or that there is a defect in the model. A few outliers can be
        expected. Right clicking on them causes them to be excluded from (filtered out
        of) the main refinement. They can be re-instated from the Filter menu. Observed
        Friedif values much larger than the estimated Friedif values indicate that there
        is a good probability that the absolute structure can be reliably determined.

      consistent and probably the most reliable estimates of the absolute structure. If

      In this example Filter_1 (the minimum acceptable Bijboet difference
      signal&amp;Noise ratio) was left at the default on 0.5. Because the material
      material contained only light atoms, most of the Bijvoet differences were tiny,
      causing the exclusion of very many Friedel pairs. Filter_1 was reset manually to
      something like 0.0001. A signal of this small magnitude is very unreliable, but the
      Robust Re-weighting down weights the worst outliers.</td>
