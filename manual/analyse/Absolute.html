<center><h1>Absolute Structure Determination</h1></center>


<p>
All materials in a non-centrosymmetric space group will have an absolute
structure.<br>
This may arise either because the material is composed of
enantiopure chiral molecules (eg sucrose) or because achiral entities
are arranged into a chiral structure (e.g. SiO4 in quartz).

<br>
For
non-centrosymmetric achiral materials, the crystal will have one or more
polar directions which must be correctly assigened if the Polar Axis
Dispersion Error is to be avoided.

<br>
 For non-centrosymmetric chiral
 crystals, the Absolute Cofiguration of the material can be assigned
if the absolute structure determination was successful.

<br>
For a quick overview of absolute structurures and configuration, see:
<i>Absolute Configuration Determination: Is There More Information in the
Data?. D.J. Watkin, and A.L. Thompson, Acta Cryst., A65, s307
(2009).</i>

<h3> Absolute Configuration.  The Flack "x" parameter</h3>

<p>
CRYSTALS has two different refineable parameters to help with the
determination of absolute structure. <br>
The oldest, the Rodger's "eta" parameter is a multiplier onto f", and
takes the value +1 if the model has the correct hand, and -1 if it needs
inverting. Flack showed that this parameter is unreliable as eta
approaches zero.<br>
The Flack "x" parameter is the mixing term in
<br> F^2 = (1-x)F^2+h + xF^2-h <br>
and takes the value zero if the model has the correct hand, and +1 if it needs
inverting.  <br>
Either the Rodger's or Flack parameter should be refined simultaneously
with the other structural parameters since its value will influence
them, and they in turn will influence the s.u. on the absolute
configuration parameter.<br>
<strong> Interpreting the Absolure Configuration Parameters</strong><br>
<p style="font-size:80%">
If the s.u. on the Flack parameter is greater than 0.30, the X-ray data
contain no significant anomalous information so that the absolute configuration
cannot be assigned by X-ray means. The value of x can be set to zero and not refined.
 (It may be appropriate to report x and its s.u. to demonstrate that the
calculation was actually performed).  <br>
If the s.u. is small enough (&lt0.04), then the parameter itself can be evaluated.
If it falls close to zero or unity, then the absolute configuration has been determined.
If it falls within this range, but is significantly distant from the bounds,
the material is probably twinned by inversion.

<b>Plots:</b><br>
The Flack equation: <b>Io = (1-x)Im<sup>+</sup> - x.Im<sup>-</sup> </b>
can be rearranged to give <b>Do = (1-2x).Dm</b> so that a plot of Do vs
Dm
will yield the Flack parameter, <i>x</i>.<br>
A similar plot using the Parsons' Quotients can also be computed. See
<i>Parsons, S. & Flack, H. (2004). Acta Cryst. A60, s61. </i> ,
<i>Amber L. Thompson and David J. Watkin.
J. Appl. Cryst. (2011). 44, 1017–1022</i> and
<i>Simon Parsons, Phillip Pattison and Howard D. Flack,
Acta Cryst. (2012). A68, 736–749</i> for justification.<br>
The equation can be further rearranged to give <b>Dc-Do = 2x.Dc</b> so that
a plot of the residual Dc-Do against Dc also yields x. For small values
of <i>x</i>, the spread parallel to the vertical axis mainly represents
the noise in the signal. <a href="./post-flack.pdf"><b>See this document
for details of the implementation.</b></a>

These plots were introduced by Flack (Analysing Friedel averages and differences

(green) cluster around and along the unit gradient, with a similar dispersion to the
anomalous averages (red).  For a poor anomalous scatterer, the differences cluster

For a sample with strong anonalous differences, this should be a line of
unit gradient, with little scatter and no curving tails.
If the gradient is not unity, there is suspicion that the least squares
weights in the main refinement are inappropriate or that the structural
model is deficient (extinction, disorder, missing atoms, mis-typed atoms).
 However, a few points off the unit gradient
line near the ends of the line are not important.<br><br>

For a reliable determination, the number of unpaired reflection should
be small. <br>
The number of Friedel pairs used should be similar to the number found.
If many have been rejected, this may mean that some of the data has been
badly measured.<br>
The number of reflections used in accumulating the scatterplot should
similar to the number found above.  If a large fraction have been
omitted, this may mean that the anomalous scattering is very weak. Changing
the filters to accept more data may just introduce rubbish reflections.
In particular, if you have tp raise the value of Filter_2 this may
indicate poor data scaling or uncorrected absorption effects.
<a href="#filters">See Filters, below</a><br><br>

 The Do-Dc Rfactor is computed from<br>
<pre><code>
R = 100 * |Do - Dc| / |Do|
</code></pre>
<br>
If the weighted averages of x and y (the plot axes) are far from zero,
there may be a systematic error in the data or the model<br>
The larger the rms values, the greater the dispersion of the data.  This
could either be due to a strong anomalous signal, or to a lot of noise.
The plot should make the choice evident.<br>
The Roots are the eigenvalues of the scatterplot (Prinicipal Component
Analysis).  For a Do/Dc or Qo/Qc plot them largest root should have an
angle (with the x-axis) of 45 degrees. The minor root is a measure of
the noise. You want a big major and a small minor axis. For a Ro/Dc
plot the major axis should make a small angle with the x-axis. The minor
root measures the noise.
<br><br>
For the Do/Dc and Qo/Qc plots the correltaion coefficient and the
coefficient of determination (R<sup>2</sup>) should be
large. Small values mean that the values of Do or Qo are not determined
by the values of Dc or Qc.
<br>
The slope of the plot should be close to unity, and the intercept close
to zero.
<br>
The Normal Probability Plot should have a unit gradient.   values far
from unity may mean that the weights for the main Least Squares have not
been properly determined, or that there is a defect in the model.  A few
outliers can be expected.  Right clicking on them causes them to be
excluded from (filtered out of) the main refinement.  They can be
re-instated from the Filter menu.




Observed Friedif values much larger than the estimated Friedif values
indicate that there is a good probability that the absolute structure
can be reliably determined.
