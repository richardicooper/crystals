                     THE BACKGROUND OF THE SYSTEM
       
         The  SIR  (Semi-Invariants Representation ) package has  been
      developed for solving crystal structures by direct methods.
         The representation theory, proposed by Giacovazzo (1977,1980)
      allowed  the  derivation  of  powerful  methods  for  estimating
      structure invariants (s.i.) and structure seminvariants (s.s.).
      The  mathematical  approach  makes  full  use of the space group
      symmetry.  SIR uses symmetry in a quite general way allowing the
      estimation  and  use  of  s.i. and s.s. in all the space groups. 
      The  range of options available to experienced crystallographers
      for  choosing  their  own  way  of solving crystal structures is
      rather wide.  However  scientists untrained in direct methods or
      experienced  people  trustful in the  SIR default mode often can
      solve crystal structures without personal intervention.
          The setting up of the  SIR program was initiated a few years
      ago.  The present version ( SIR92 ) of the program is the  third  
      release which we consider suitable for distribution and includes
      several new features  with  respect  to  the  previous  version, 
      SIR88. 

 


       -------------------------------------------------------------- 
                       Notes on the implementation                      
       -------------------------------------------------------------- 


         All modifications to the program have to be  applied  to  the 
      file SPECIFIC. Search in this file for the string "CHANGE".
         Depending  on  the  refinement program available the user can
      fix  the   default  format  for  the   output  peak    file   by  
      modifying  the variable 'jout' in BLOCK DATA SIRBLK . 
         Troubles can occur because  of  different behaviour of compi-
      lers.  Frequently the sintax of the open statement is different.
      These statements can be changed by editing  the  routines  JOPEN 
      and  KOPEN  (  for   sequential    and    direct   access   file 
      respectively). 
         Some computers have some reserved logical unit numbers. These 
      values  can  be  changed  editing  the BLOCK DATA SIRBLK.
         SIR  uses  a  sequential  file  to  read  scattering  factors
      constants, atomic radii etc.  The  name  of  this  file must  be
      assigned to the variable 'ffile' in BLOCK DATA SIRBLK.
         SIR uses  a  direct access file to preserve data and results,
      two  sequential   files  to   store    peak    coordinates   for 
      refinement and for graphics. To change their default  name   the  
      user has  to  modify  the  value  of   the  variables  FNAME(1), 
      FNAME(3), FNAME(4), and EXT(1), EXT(3),  EXT(4)  in  BLOCK  DATA 
      SIRBLK. 
         For  VAX/VMS implementations the user has to modify the value
      of the variable 'nlen' in BLOCK DATA SIRBLK.

         SIR uses two subroutines ( sirtime & sirdate  )  to  get  the 
      time and the  date.  The  calls  to  operative  system  are  not 
      standard. 
         Please customize these subroutines following comments inside. 
         Using a Unix-like operative system the user  has  to  compile 
      and link some code in C-language. Search for "CHANGE" in  the  C 
      file ( xmr92.c ). 

      GRAPHIC INTERFACE IN SIR92

         This feature is available, at the moment, on UNIX Workstation,
      VMS Workstation and P.C. (386,486). The  P.C.  version  of SIR92
      is  distributed in  EXE format.
         To be able to implement the graphic  part  the  user  has  to 
      compile the FORTRAN files and one C-file and then link  together 
      using the library of X-Window. An example of  Makefile  follows. 
      Consider carefully <TAB>  and <BACKSLASH> characters.

         The graphic part uses an ASCII file,  XSIR92.TXT,  containing 
      in the first line the sequence of UNIX  commands  to  obtain  an 
      hard copy of the graphic window. The user has to customize  this 
      line. Following lines contain the text for the on-line HELP. The  
      path and the name of this  file  have   to   be   specified   in  
      BLOCKDATA SIRBLK (file SPECIFIC) using the variable SIRTX. 
         The default dimensions of the graphic window  are  stored  in 
      the variables KSCRX and KSXRY in the same BLOCK DATA (720x500). 
         The default use of the graphic window is  determined  by  the 
      value of the variable KSCREEN in this block data. If KSCREEN  is 
      set to zero the window will not be displayed unless  the  WINDOW 
      command is used.

         The main modules of the program are :
      SIR92, LIST, DATA,  NORMAL,  SEMINVARIANTS,  INVARIANTS,  PHASE, 
      FOURIER/LEAST-SQUARES, EXPORT/RESTART, PATTERSON.


      SIR92 module
                   

         It interpretes commands and calls desired routines.

      LIST module
                   
  
         It is the software interface between SIR92 and the direct
      access file on which data and results are stored.

  
      DATA module 


         This routine reads  the  basic  crystallographic  information 
      like cell parameters, space group symbol, unit cell content  and 
      reflections. It includes  a  modified version of the  subroutine 
      SYMM   by   Burzlaff & Hountas  (1982).  Symmetry  operators and 
      information   necessary   to  identify  structure  seminvariants 
      ( estimated in SEMINVARIANTS routine ) are directly derived from 
      the space group  symbol.  
         Diffraction  data are checked in order to find out equivalent
      reflections or systematically absent reflections (which are then
      excluded from the data set) and, eventually, reflections  (weak) 
      not  included  in  the  data  set   (Cascarano,   Giacovazzo   & 
      Guagliardi, 1991). 

      NORMAL module


         In this module diffraction intensities are  normalized  using 
      the Wilson method. Statistical analysis of intensities  is  made 
      in order to suggest the presence or  absence  of  the  inversion 
      centre and to  identify   the  possible  presence  and  type  of 
      pseudotranslational symmetry (Cascarano,  Giacovazzo  and  Luic, 
      1988  a,b;  Fan, Yao & Qian, 1988).   Possible  deviations  ( of 
      displacive type ) from ideal  pseudotranslational  symmetry  are 
      also detected.  All  the above  information is not used as prior 
      information  in the next steps  of  SIR,  unless  the  directive 
      PSEUDO is given to the  program. 
         When some additional prior  information,  besides  positivity 
      and atomicity of electron density, is available, then a suitable

      renormalization of structure factors is made.
         SIR  is  able  to  deal  with  the following  types  of prior
      information:
         a) pseudotranslational  symmetry, identified by normalization
            routine or other source;
         b) a well  oriented  and  well  positioned molecular fragment
            (Camalli, Giacovazzo & Spagna,1985; Burla,Cascarano,Fares,
            Giacovazzo, Polidori & Spagna,1989).

      SEMINVARIANTS module


         This routine is not used in the default run of SIR.
         One-phase  s.s.  are  estimated  by  means of their first and
      second   representation   as  described  by  Giacovazzo  (1978),
      Cascarano et al. (1984). As a default the second  representation
      is calculated.
         Two-phase   s.s.  are  estimated  by  means  of  their  first 
      representation as described by Giacovazzo et al. (1979),  Burla,
      Giacovazzo and Polidori(1988).
         The  estimated  s.s.  are  stored  in the direct access file;
      those  evaluated  with highest reliability will be actively used 
      in  the  phasing  process  while  the  others will contribute to
      compute,  with  other  phase  relationships, the figure of merit
      CPHASE.
 
      INVARIANTS module


         Up to 20000  triplets  relating reflections with normalized E 
      values greater than a  given  threshold  (strong  triplets)  are  
      stored for active use in the phasing  process.   Also   triplets 
      (psizero triplets ) relating two reflections with large  E   and 
      one with  E close to zero are generated: they are actively  used 
      in the phasing process (Giacovazzo, 1993) and define  a  special 
      figure of merit  (PSCOMB).  Special  types  of  triplets  (psi-E 
      triplets) based on two strong and one  intermediate  reflections 
      (just below the threshold of strong reflections) are  calculated 
      and used in the FOURIER/LEAST-SQUARES module in order to  extend
      phase information (Altomare, Cascarano,  Giacovazzo  &  Viterbo, 
      1991). 
         Negative quartets  are  generated  by  combining  the psizero
      triplets in pairs,  and those with cross-magnitudes smaller than
      a given threshold  are   estimated  by   means  of  their  first
      representation,   as  described  by  Giacovazzo  (1976).   These
      quartets  are  be  actively  used  in   the   phasing   process 
      (Giacovazzo, Burla & Cascarano,  1992)  and  will   provide   an 
      important contribution to the FOM  CPHASE. 
         Active triplets may be estimated according to Cochran's(1955)
      p-3 distribution: the  concentration  parameter of the von Mises
      distribution is then
          
                     C =  2 * E(h) * E(k) * E(h-k) / sqrt(N)     (1)


         Triplets  can  also  be estimated  according  to their second
      representation ( i.e. p-10 formula,  as described  by Cascarano,
      Giacovazzo,  Camalli,  Spagna, Burla, Nunzi and Polidori,1984 ).
      The concentration parameter of the new  von Mises ( i.e. of  the 
      same form of Cochran's ) distribution is given by 

                     G = C (1 + q)                        (2)

      where  q  is  a function  ( positive  or  negative )  of all the
      magnitudes in the second representation  of  the triplet.  The G
      values are rescaled on the  C values and the triplets are ranked 
      in decreasing order of  G.  The top  relationships  represent  a
      better selection of triplets with phase value close to zero than
      that obtained when ranking according to  C. These triplets  will
      be actively used in the phase determination process.
         Triplets estimated with a negative G represent a sufficiently
      good selection of relationships close to 180 degrees  to be used
      both for active use in the phasing process ( Giacovazzo, Burla & 
      Cascarano, 1992 ) and for the  calculation  of  a  powerful  FOM 
      (CPHASE). 
         Triplets with G close  to zero  are  expected  to have values
      widely  dispersed  around  90  or  270  degrees  and are used to
      compute an enantiomorph sensitive  FOM.  A similar  FOM  is also
      computed  using  quartets estimated with a very small concentra-
      tion parameter.
         As  a  default, triplets  are  estimated  according  to  p-10 
      formula. 
         The  parameter  C  of the Cochran distribution ( say p-3 ) is
      suitably modified when prior information, such as that described
      above in  the  section  "NORMAL  module",  is  available.  Then 
      triplet phases are  no longer expected  to  be around zero (see 
      quoted references) and may lie anywhere between zero and two pi. 

      PHASE module


         In  the  SIR program  the most  reliable one-phase  s.s.  are
      treated  as known phases. Besides triplets, also the most relia-
      ble negative quartets and two-phase s.s. may be actively used.
         Each relationship is used with its proper weight: the concen-
      tration  parameter  of  the  first  representation for  quartets 
      and two-phase s.s., and  C or  G  for triplets. 

   
   
                 -  convergence/divergence procedure  -                

         The convergence procedure (Germain, Main & Woolfson, 1970) is
      a convenient  way  of defining an optimum starting set of phases 
      to be expanded by the tangent formula or by any other algorithm.
         When  the  p-10  formula  is used,  as  a  default, a special
      convergence process is devised  which  chooses  the starting set
      according to

       <alpha> = Sum ( G*D1(G)*D1(<alpha k>) ) * D1(<alpha h-k>)  (3)


      as  suggested  by  Giacovazzo  (1979)  and  by Burla, Cascarano,
      Giacovazzo, Nunzi & Polidori (1987), with
  
                    D1(G) = I1(G) / I0(G) 
  
      I1 and I0 represent modified Bessel functions of order  one  and
      zero respectively.  The summation in  (3)  is over all relation-
      ships defining the reflection h.  If  p-3  formula  is  used the
      default choice is
         
                    <alpha>  = Sum ( C * D1(C) )              (4)
   
         Once the  starting set  has been  defined, a good pathway for
      phase expansion is determined by a divergence procedure.  In the
      divergence map, starting from the  reflections in  the  starting
      set, each new reflection  is linked  to the preceding ones  with
      the highest value of <alpha>.
    
                  -  phase extension and refinement -                  

         The  starting  set defined by the  preceding  step is usually
      formed  by the origin ( and enantiomorph )  fixing  reflections,
      a few one phase s.s. and a number of other phases  which  may be
      obtained:
               a) by  magic integer  permutation ( White & Woolfson,
                  1975; Main, 1978 ),
               b) by a random approach (Baggio, Woolfson, Declercq &
                  Germain, 1978; Burla, Cascarano & Giacovazzo, 1992).
         The option a) is the default, b) runs if the directive RANDOM
      is used.  In  this  last  case a large number ( depending on the
      available computer time ) of trials can be requested.
         If a partial structure  is  available ( the directive PARTIAL
      should  have been  used in the normalization routine ) the PHASE
      routine  is  automatically  able  to  take that information into
      account.  No further directives are  strictly necessary. However
      directives  SYMBOLS,   SPECIALS,  MAXTRIAL  may   be   used   to 
      change default values. 
         Phase expansion  and refinement are carried out by means of a
      tangent  formula  using  triplets, negative  quartets,  psi-zero 
      triplets   and    the    most   reliable   two-phase   structure 
      seminvariants.  In  the  weighting  scheme   the    experimental 
      distributions of the alpha parameters  are  forced to match with 
      the theoretical ones (Burla, Cascarano, Giacovazzo,   Nunzi  and 
      Polidori, 1987). 
         For each phase  set  several  FOM's  are computed  using  all 
      invariants   and   seminvariants   estimated  by  means  of  the 
      representation method.  Their  meaning and an optimized  way  of 
      combining all the computed  FOM's to  give  a  highly  selective 
      combined figure of merit  ( CFOM ) is described in the papers by 
      Cascarano, Giacovazzo  and  Viterbo  (1987)  and  by  Cascarano, 
      Giacovazzo & Guagliardi (1992). 
         All  FOM's,  as well as the combined CFOM, are expected to be
      equal to 1.0 for correct solutions.  CFOM larger than 0.5 can be 
      considered encouraging.
         If  pseudotranslational  symmetry  is present then CFOM > 0.3
      may characterize the correct solution.
 

 
      FOURIER/LEAST-SQUARES module


         The sets of phases  generated  by  the  tangent  routine  are 
      first expanded through psi-E relationships and  then  passed  to  
      the fast fourier  transform  routine  written  by  L.F.Ten  Eick 
      (1977) and subsequently modified by the MULTAN team  (  Main  et 
      al. 1980 ). 
         Several  additional  features  have  been  introduced  in the
      present version.
 
        a) special positions are handled, peaks very close to symmetry
           elements  are  moved  onto  symmetry  elements,   the  site
           symmetry  is  defined  and  the  atomic occupancy factor is
           calculated;  key  numbers  for designating free, coupled or
           fixed positional parameters for  least-squares  subroutines
           are  also  calculated together with symmetry conditions  on 
           the thermal ellipsoid.
 
        b) The  set  of  peaks  provided by the peak search routine is
           automatically  analyzed  in   order   to   provide    sound 
           molecular fragments. If ( as usually )  the  atomic species 
           present in the unit cell are known,  their atomic radii and 
           (eventually)  their chemical coordination are used in order 
           to automatically identify fragments and relate peaks to the 
           atomic species (automatic labelling of peaks). 

         The  above  information  is   automatically   processed   via 
      least-squares Fourier cycles in order to  complete  the  crystal 
      structure, reject false peaks and refine  structural  parameters 
      (Altomare,  Cascarano,  Giacovazzo  &   Guagliardi   1993).   An 
      isotropic diagonal matrix refinement  is  used  which  does  not 
      involve H atoms. The final R's usually vary from 0.08 to 0.15.  

      EXPORT/RESTART module


         Atomic parameters produced by the preceding  module,  stored 
      in the direct access file, can be exported in ASCII file  in  a 
      format suitable for other programs such  as  CRYSTALS,  SHELX92, 
      MOLPLOT, MOLDRAW, SCHAKAL, etc.
         If a graphic interface is available it is possible to  delete 
      or relabel some atoms  and  restart  the  FOURIER  LEAST-SQUARES 
      procedure. If the graphic interface  is  not  available,  it  is 
      possible to re-run the program after having  modified  the  atom  
      list  through the command RESTART. 

      PATTERSON module


         In SIR92 it is possible to  compute  a  PATTERSON  map  using 
      various coefficients.


 
       -------------------------------------------------------------- 
                         Commands and their use                        
       -------------------------------------------------------------- 


         The  input consists of a sequence of comments, commands
      and directives. The  commands  are  headed  by '%' character and
      directives must follow the related command.
         SIR92 recognizes the following commands:

      %INITIALIZE        initialize the direct access file 
                         (to override previous results and data)
      %DATA              Data input routine
      %NORMAL            normalization routine
      %SEMINV            seminvariants routine
      %INVARIANTS        invariants routine
      %PHASE             converge-tangent routine
      %FOURIER           Fourier/Least-Squares routine
      %EXPORT
      %END               end of the input file
      %PATTERSON

      %JOB               a caption is printed in the output 
      %CONTINUE          the  program  runs  in  default conditions
                         from the last given command up to the end      
      %STRUCTURE string  this command is used to  specify the  name
                         of  the  structure  to  investigate.   The 
                         program creates  the  name  of  the  files 
                         needed by adding the appropriate extension 
                         to the structure name. The file names are: 
                            string.bin -> direct access file
                            string.ins -> final coordinates file
                            string.plt -> file for graphics
                         If this command  is  not  used   the  default 
                         string "STRUCT" (instead of the name  of  the 
                         structure) is used to create file names. 
      %WINDOW [ x y ]    graphic window is required.  Optionally 
                         it is possible  to  increase  the  dimensions 
                         using x and y. Default values are 720,500.
      %NOWINDOW          graphic window is suppressed
      %RESTART           Fourier/Least-Squares restart routine

         Directives  are described below, in the sections dedicated to 
      the various routines. 
         All  commands  and  directives  are  in free format  (between 
      columns 1-80) and are case  independent.  Only  the  first  four 
      characters are significant. 
         The keywords can start in any position.If the first non-blank 
      character is ">", then the record is interpretated as a comment. 
         SIR92  preserves  intermediate  results.  For   example,   if 
      invariant   estimates  have  been  already  obtained  during   a 

      previous run of SIR92, in a new run the commands 
                                 %INVARIANTS                          
      can be omitted. 
         Commands  can  be  given  in  any  order, under the following 
      conditions: 
 
               - first routine  used  must  be  DATA, if it has not be 
                 used in a previous run;
               - Invariants and Seminvariants routines have no meaning 
                 if diffraction moduli are not normalized;
               - PHASE routine has no meaning if no triplets have been
                 calculated;
               - FOURIER routine cannot run before PHASE routine.
               - PSEUDO  and  PARTIAL  directives  require  their  own 
                 normalization. If one  renounces  to  use  PSEUDO  or 
                 PARTIAL information the SIR must  be  restarted  from
                 %DATA command.

         The  minimal  information  needed by SIR is  consists  (  see 
      Example 1 ) of: 
 
               - cell parameters
               - cell content
               - space group symbol
               - reflections
 
         The following limitations hold for commands and directives:

               - PTEN cannot be used if the directive PSEUDO is on;
               - seminvariants cannot be requested if PSEUDO is on;
               - if PARTIAL is on, PSEUDO and RANDOM cannot be used;
               - the directive SYMBOLS is of no use if RANDOM is on.
               - PARTIAL and GENER are not compatible 
               - PATTERSON followed by continue is not permitted.

      CELL  a  b  c  alpha  beta  gamma
                
           Cell  dimensions.  a,b and c are in  angstroms, alpha, beta
           and gamma in degrees.

      SPACEGROUP string
                
           String  is the symbol of the space group ( i.e.  P 21 21 21
           or  P 21/C  or  R -3 ), according to  International  Tables
           (1952).  Blanks are  necessary among the items constituting
           the space group symbol.
 
      SHIFT  sx sy sz  
      
           Origin  shift  components.  They must be integral multiples
           of 1/24
 
      CONTENTS  El1  n1  El2   n2   El3  n3   .........
      
           Unit cell contents.  Eli is the  chemical symbol  of atomic
           type i, ni is the corresponding number of atoms in the unit
           cell ( to a maximum of 8 atomic types ).  For each chemical
           element up to Cf ( Z=98 )  scattering  factor constants are
           stored, together with information on the atomic  number and
           weight, covalent  and  Van-der-Waals radii., etc. in a file   
           (see notes on implementation).

      RHOMAX x  
      
           Maximum  value of  (sin(theta)/lambda)**2  accepted for re-
           flections to be used. The default is   that  all  the  data 
           accepted. 

      RECORD n
             
           Specificies the number of reflections per record when n>1.

      FORMAT string 
            
           String is the run time format to read  reflections. Default
           value for string is (3I4,2F8.2).


      GENER  

           Reflections not in data will be generated having
           (sin(theta)/lambda)**2 value less than the maximum value of
           (sin(theta)/lambda)**2 in input. 

      NOSIGMA

           To be used when sigma(F) values are meaningless.

      REFLECTIONS string 
                  
           If  string  is  equal  to  FOLLOW  then the program expects
           reflections  on  card reader after the  %END  or  %CONTINUE
           command. Otherwise string is the name  of  the  reflections
           file.
           Records have n reflections, each with  h,k,l,F(obs),  sigma 
           (F) where h,k,l  are  integer (less than 63).
           The  end  of  reflections  is detected  using  one  of  the
           following:
                      - blank record;
                      - end of file;
           Negative values  of  F(obs)  are  allowed; negative values
           of sigma(F) are forbidden.

      FOSQUARE

           Program expects h,k,l, F**2, sigma(F**2).

       -------------------------------------------------------------- 


      NREF n
      
           Number of reflections  with  largest  E-values subject to a
           minimum value of E(obs) = 1.2.
           Default = 4 * number of independent atoms
                         + 50 if centrosymmetric
                         + 50 if triclinic + 150
           to a maximum of 499. If PSEUDO directive is on, the program
           tries to use all the E's down to 1.2.

      NZRO n
      
           Number   of   smallest  E-values   to  calculate  psi(zero) 
           triplets. Default is 1/3 of strong reflections. 

      BFAC x  
           
           Temperature factor if the user wants to supply it.

      PSEUDO n(1,1) n(2,1) n(3,1) n(4,1) n(1,2)  . . .  n(4,3)
            
           If  parameters  are equal to zero, or omitted, the normali-
           zation routine performs statistics for the pseudotraslation
           effects and  renormalizes  the reflections on  assuming the
           most probable pseudotranslation as prior information.
           If user  wants  to  supply  a  specific  pseudotranlational 
           symmetry, and  this corresponds to a class given in Table 1 
           the n(1,1) can be set to the class  number  and  the  other 
           values must be omitted. 
           If  the  pseudotranslation  is  more  complex, it should be
           specified by up to 3 sets of 4 values n(i,j) so that
   
               ( n(1,j)*h + n(2,j)*k +n(3,j)*l =n(4,j)*m )   j=1,3  
   
           where m is an integer number.

      PARTIAL
              
           To  perform  the  procedure  which  aims  at recovering the
           complete structure from a partial one.  This instruction is
           followed by the list of atomic information ( one per card )
           consisting of atomic type, x, y, z and optionally occupancy
           factor ( default 1.0). See Example 3 - 4.

           where natom is the number of  atoms in the cell and msym is
           the number of symmetry operators of the space group.
       
      CORRECTION x  
                
           If a pseudotranslation procedure is on, a correction factor
           depending on  x is applied to the probabilistic argument of
           weak-weak-weak triplets when they are present.  The default
           value is calculated by program.
           x = -1 eliminates weak-weak-weak triplets,
           x =  1 corresponds to the largest confidence in them.

      BIG n

           This keyword is used to modify the number  of  triplets  to 
           estimate. If n is omitted, up to  20000  triplets  will  be 
           estimated. (Default 8000).

           directive is omitted  x  is  assumed  as  the minimum value 
           of G ( or C ) among the positive triplets.Very large values

           The  serial number of the  set from which  to calculate the
           E-map. If  'SET  n'  is  not  specified,  the  set with the
           highest combined figure of merit will be used, and then  if
           FOURIER  routine  is  rerun  the  set with the next highest
           combined figure of merit will be used.
     
      MAP 
         
           If  MAP   is  specified,  the Fourier-map  will be  printed 
           on the lineprinter. The  printing  of  the  Fourier-map  is 
           rarely used.  The output is in sections of constant y  with 
           x across the  page and z running down it on a grid of about 
           three  points  per angstrom. The  maximum  number  of  grid 
           points across the page is 36 ( i.e. about twelve  angstroms 
           in length). If more are needed, a new page is started. 
    
      LEVEL n   
           
           All  numerical values in the Fourier-map  greater  than   n  
           will be underlined  with  ****  in the  lineprinter  output 
           to facilitate contouring. The default is 100.  The  map  is 
           automatically scaled between  +&-  999 (approximately)   at 
           the grid points at which it is calculated.  Note,  however, 
           that it is printed between +&- 99.     

      GRID x       
           
           The grid on which the Fourier-map is evaluated will have  a 
           spacing of approximately  x angstroms. The default  spacing 
           is computed by the program. 
       
      LIMITS  l1  l2  l3  
            
           The E-map will be printed from 0 to l1 along x, from  0  to 
           l2 along y, from 0 to l3 along z. (This  directive  can  be 
           used only if associated to MAP directive). 
     
      PEAKS n   
            
           The  number of  peaks  to be  searched  for in the map. The

                                sum (occ(i)*m) = 1.3 * n 
           where  occ  is the  crystallographic site occupancy factor,
           m is the number of  symmetry operators, n is the number  of
           non-hydrogen atoms in the unit cell.

      LAYY
      LAYZ

           This directive can be used if MAP directive is  given.  The 
           Fourier-map will be printed in section of constant x (or y,

           If n is equal to zero only the E-map will be calculated.

      FRAGMENT string

       -------------------------------------------------------------- 
                   When  default  SIR  fails:  strategies             
       -------------------------------------------------------------- 

 
         Very  often  crystal  structures are solved by SIR using only
      default settings.  In cases of  failure, the user can modify the
      default pathway in order to improve the success rate.
         The  number  of  options  is quite large and some of them are
      suggested  here.
         The  CFOM  figure of merit  is in practice an estimate of the
      probability  that  a trial  solution is correct.  If the highest
      CFOM  does  not  correspond  to the correct solution, subsequent
      CFOM's may be successful. 
         A  special  problem  arises  when  several  nearly equivalent
      CFOM's  are  available for different trials. Then the individual
      FOM's  have   to   be  carefully  considered  by  the  user.  In 
      particular the additional R(x,y)  figure  of  merit  (Cascarano, 
      Giacovazzo  &  Guagliardi,  1992)  can   also   provide   useful 
      suggestions. 
         The magic  integer  procedure  is an effective and simple way 
      for starting a  multisolution process.   Second   representation  
      formula  for triplet  invariants  proved much more powerful than 
      first representation   formula   therefore   it  is  used  as  a 
      default for estimating  triplets.  In  case   of  failure,   the 
      user can increase the number  of  symbols,  or  use  the  RANDOM 
      procedure.
         The  use  of  1- and 2- phase  seminvariants  are not default
      choices (they require additional computing  time  and often they
      are not necessary for the success of SIR). If symmetry is rather
      high,  several  seminvariants can be reliably estimated: some of
      them  will  actively  be  used in phase expansion and refinement
      process,  others will be used as figures of merit. Sometimes the
      additional  estimation  of one or few one-phase seminvariants is
      enough for solving crystal structures.
         A check for possible pseudotranslational symmetry  is  always
      made  by  SIR:   if   PSEUDO   keyword  is  not  activated  then
      information  is given but not used in the phasing process.  If a
      pseudotranslational symmetry has been found by the normalization
      routine a new run of  SIR may be started including  the  keyword 
      PSEUDO. 
         Sometime  a molecular fragment is located in the E-map, or it
      is available from other sources ( i.e.,Patterson,... ), which is
      too  small for recovering the complete crystal structure via the
      usual Least-Squares - Fourier methods;  then the keyword PARTIAL
      may be activated in the normalization routine.

         Perhaps because of a faulty data  collection  strategy,  weak
      reflections may not be included in diffraction data.This lack of
      information influences both the normalization process (scale and
      overall  thermal  factors are affected by systematic errors; the
      experimental  E-distribution  is often non-centric even when the
      crystal  structure  is  centrosymmetric)  and  the estimation of
      1-  and  2-phase  seminvariants   and  of  triplet  and  quartet
      invariants: in particular, a reduced number of negative triplets
      ( via p-10 formula )  and  of  negative  quartets is calculated.

      Success  in  the  structure  solution  may be obtained  if  weak
      reflections are introduced in the data set. 
         Even  if  there are still a large number of options available
      four of them are quoted for special cases:
  
         a) the value of NREF ( number of reflections actively used in
            the phasing process ) is  fixed  by  SIR. For some special
            structures the ratio  "number of active triplets/NREF"  is
            too  small ( less than 10 ).  Larger  values  of  NREF may 
            improve the phasing procedure.
  
  
         b) high (or low) resolution reflections may occasionally play
            a too important role in the first steps of convergence and
            divergence process.  Fixing  a  thermal factor lower  ( or
            larger )  than  that provided by the normalization routine
            may successfull change convergence and divergence process.
  
         c) an alternative space group should be carefully considered.

      Example 1
         The  following  example shows the maximum default use of SIR.
      Most of the structures  can  be solved in this way.  Diffraction
      data  are  in  the  file  BOBBY.HKL  in  format (3I4,2F8.2), one 
      reflection per record.

         In the following example the use of one and two-phase semin-
      variants  is  requested  together  with 7 symbols to permute in 
      PHASE routine. It is assumed that SIR was already runned before
      (thus normalization and invariants are not needed).
