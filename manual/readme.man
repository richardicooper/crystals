Data Organisation

#ZData organisation#

It's always a good idea to keep your data organised, and it will also
help for the purposes of running CRYSTALS.

#P1. Organise your computer. Create a master folder to
hold all your structures and keep each structure in a sub-folder of this:
e.g. _I{c:\strs\compound1\

#P2. Copy the crystallographic data in to the sub-folder. CRYSTALS likes
data from Nonius CAD4, DIP or KappaCCD machines, or
alternatively simply a SHELX format .INS/RES and .HKL file.

#_B{Take _B{care: _B{If _B{you _B{open _B{a _B{data _B{file _B{with _B{WORD,
_B{you _B{may _B{accidentally _B{save _B{it _B{as _B{a _B{WORD _B{document.
Use notepad, EDIT, or some other _I{ASCII text editor.

#P3. Click the CRYSTALS icon, and use the folder browser to find the
folder containing your data. Click OK.

#P4. The CRYSTALS window is divided into several areas:
# On the right: _B{The _B{model _B{window, initially filled with a pretty
backdrop of Oxford (submissions of new backdrops for future releases
are welcome!). This will display the model once the structure is solved.

# Above the model: _B{The _B{model _B{toolbar, lets you change the appearance
and functioning of the model window.

# At the very top: _B{The _B{menu _B{bar. The pull down menus represent
the principal stages of structure analysis, working from left to right.

# Below that: _B{The _B{main _B{toolbar, provides quick access to some
common options that should also be in the menus.

# On the upper left:_B{The _B{text _B{output _B{window. This
displays the results of calculations, or asks the user questions.
It has a large scroll-back capability.

# Below that: _B{The _B{information _B{tabs. This panel can be hidden away,
as can the toolbars, by clicking the little triangles in the bar that
divides them from their neighbouring elements.

# And below that: _B{The _B{text _B{input _B{line. This is below the
output window. The cursor automatically moves to this area when you type.
The 'arrow' keys enable you to recover previous input (like the DOSKEY
utility). If you are a new user, you shouldn't worry too much about
the text input line.

# At the very bottom: _B{A _B{status _B{bar. Shows progress during long
calculations, and status as CRYSTALS is doing different things.

#P5. CRYSTALS creates many files:
# _B{A _B{binary _B{database for each structure,
always named CRFILEV2.DSC. _B{NEVER _B{try _B{to _B{edit _B{this _B{file. This
file enables CRYSTALS jobs to be restarted from where they were left
off. All other files may be opened with a text editor e.g.
notepad, wordpad, or edit.
# Double clicking on the .DSC file will start CRYSTALS in that folder, using
that .DSC file.
# _B{Text _B{files BETACRYS.L_I{nn and BETACRYS.M_I{nn. The number _I{nn
is automatically incremented with each run of the program. These files can
generally be deleted without looking at them unless the analysis begins to go
wrong. They provide post-mortem information.
The currently in use files may be opened quickly using the "Files" tab on the
information panel.
# _B{PUBLISH.* files. These are final listings for preparing papers.

#ZUsing the GUIDE#
#P Once you have started CRYSTALS in a given folder, nothing much happens.
To make things happen, try clicking the "GUIDE" button in the
toolbar. The GUIDE assesses where a structure analysis has got to, and
will provide a list of possible options in a pull-down menu. Choose the
required option and click OK.

#ZImporting SHELX data#
#P It is best to import the .INS or .RES file first. You can import
a file with or without atoms depending on where the data is from - CRYSTALS
will just grab all the information that it can.
# From the X-ray data menu, choose "Import SHELX file". You will need
to know the space group symbol since this information is not
present in the SHELX file format.
# Type in the file name, or find it using "Browse", click OK and the file
will be imported. (You will be asked for the spacegroup).
# Next import the reflection file. Choose "X-ray data"->"Import reflections".
The default settings are for a SHELX hkl file, so just type or browse
for the required file, and click OK.
