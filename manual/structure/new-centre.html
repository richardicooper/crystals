    <h1>New Centre Molecules</h1>
  </div>This module tries to move the connected components of a structure (Residues) so that they lie
  close to 0.5 0.5 0.5.<br />
  <br />
  The algorithm starts by using the Cheshire Groups to choose an origin shift which will
  place the first atom close to 0.5 0.5 0.5 <i>see Direct Methods in Crystallography,
  Giacovazzo, Academic Press, 1980, Chapter 2, page 57</i>. If you have a heavy atom you
  might want to make this the first atom before starting New Centre. If you know the name
  of this atom, say Zn(1), you can move it to the top of the list by issuing:<br />
  <pre>
#EDIT
MOVE Zn(1)
END
</pre><br />
  If you dont know the name, you can try sorting on the electron count or atomic weight:

  <table border="1">
    <tr>
      <td>
        <pre>
#EDIT
INSERT ELECTRON (or INSERT WEIGHT)
DSORT SPARE     
END
</pre>
      </td>

      <td>The electron count or atomic weight of each atom is inserted into the key
      <i>SPARE</i>.<br />
      DSORT sorts the values in the given key (in this case SPARE) by decreasing value.
      Any key can be sorted, eg DSORT U[iso] would put the atom with the smallest Uiso at
      the top of the atom list.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>The same origin shift is then applied to all the atoms. Remember that an origin
  shift changes the values of the A &amp; B parts of the structure factor, so if these
  have been saved (see <i>LIST 23</i>) they must be recomputed when the re-centring is
  completed.<br />
  The algorithm then applies the permitted space group operators to cluster the remaining
  connected atom fragments around the chosen atom.

  <h2>Example</h2>Choose a small test structure (for example, "cyclo" in the Demo
  suite.)<br />
  Break it into two parts by right clicking on a bond near the middle of the structure
  and choose "Break Bond" to remove that bond.<br />
  Under Structure choose "Remove Residue Nos", then "Allocate Residue Nos". The diagram
  will now show two fragments, and the table underneath will have residue numbers
  inserted<br />
  <br />
  Move one of the fragments out side of the cell by issuing:<br />
  <pre>
#EDIT
SHIFT 1.0 1.0 1.0 RESIDUE(2)
END
</pre><br />
  The structure should now show two clearly separate parts<br />
  Choose "New Centre Molecules" and the fragments will be brought together again.<br />
  <br />
  The information about the bond you broke is stored in LIST 40. Choose "Add and Remove
  Bonds" to edit this list. Delete the line which BREAKS the selected bond.
