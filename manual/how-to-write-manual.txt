#Tstring# string=Title for the volume of the manual, e.g. crystals, cameron, primer, etc.
Closing # is optional.

#Cfilename# filename=the base part of the filename for output files, eg. cameron will result in files called
cameron-1.html cameron-2.html, etc. Closing # is optional.
(This line must appear somewhere after #Z, before the end of the document, otherwise the default name will
be "manual0")

The HTML is produced in two versions: one for the web-site in a form that may be processed by
xtlweb.pl (i.e. many sub-directories with content.dat and name.dat files); and one stand-alone version
that may be distributed with the software. 
The HTML is produced on a one-file-per-chapter basis, whereas the LaTeX output (which goes on to
produce the postscript and PDF) in produced on a one-file-per-volume basis.


#Zchaptername# chaptername=title of chapter. e.g. Getting Started, Introduction, etc. Closing # is optional.

#Ysectiontitle# sectiontitle=title of chapter sections. Numbered (e.g for chapter 1) 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, etc. Closing #
is optional.


_b{word or _B{word = word appears in bold.
_i{word or _I{word = word appears in italics. 

There were lots of _{i and _{b in the text that have been fixed to be _i{ and _{b.

#P new paragraph.

#N....# ignored.

#J begin preformatted text. The next # anywhere will end the pre-formatted section.

#Iinstruction# An instruction more text may appear after the closing #, it will 
be placed on a new line. If there is no closing #, the instruction is all text up 
to the end of the line.

#Ddirective# A directive more text may appear after the closing #, it will be 
placed on a new line. If there is no closing #, the directive is all text up 
to the end of the line.

#Kkeyword# A keyword. Again, closing # is optional.

#Uhttp://www.xtl.ox.ac.uk/crystals.html# A url. This will appear as plain text in the manual, but in 
HTML documents, it will also appear as a hyperlink.

#Xindexword# indexword will appear in the index with a link to the point in the manual where the #X occurs.
Best to put these just above the chapter or section heading you are linking to, otherwise you jump in
to the document with the heading just off the top of the screen.

#Alabelanchor# Put in a label anchor called "labelanchor".

#Rlabellink# Put in a link to "labellink". The text that appears is just the chapter and section number,
but in html and pdf it is also a link to that section.

For example.

   #TTitle#
   #ZFirst Chapter#
   #YIntroduction# 
   ...
   #Y Getting Started#
   Here is some text. #Agstarted# Here is some more.
   ...
   #YAnother section#
   Here some text. See section #Rgstarted# for more information.


Nothing will appear where the #A command is, and a hyperlinked "1.2" will appear
where the #R is.

#Q and #  are turned into newlines.

There are several places in the CRYSTALS, CAMERON, GUIDE, and PRIMER, where I've found
things like

   #REGULARISE 

and had to change them to \REGULARISE, and also

   #Attempt to compile these modules

must be changed to # Attempt .....

There is no way of including a # symbol in the manuals. Excessive use of
< > & \ / should probably be avoided aswell, though they are generally okay.

The first two lines of every file are ignored as they contain page size info.

I think Lisa's program should retain backwards compatibility, as long as it can be made to ignore
#X...# #C...# #U...# #A....# and #R....#
