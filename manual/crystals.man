#YStatus#
#PVersion 14 of CRYSTALS continues to be based on a
 version (Issue 2) written by J.R. Carruthers in collaboration with
 J.S.Rollett during 1977-78, which was a rewrite of the 1975 CRYSTALS 
 system implemented  
 on the ICL 1900 series of computers. It contains significant
 contributions by Paul Betteridge, David Kinna, Lisa Pearce, Allen Larson,
 and Eric Gabe and many students and visitors to the Chemical
 Crystallography Laboratory, Oxford. The graphical user interface (GUI)
 was written by Richard Cooper as part of a Part II and D
 Phil project (supported by a CCDC studentship) in collaboration with
 Ludwig Macko and Markus Neuburger in Basel, who were working on a
 parallel Macintosh interface.

#Q
#PWhile CRYSTALS can still be executed in 'batch mode' (ASCII file in,
ASCII file out), the major demand is now for the version running under
Windows on Intel processors, with some small demand for the
LINUX version. The GUI permits the user to continually see the structure
as it develops, and to interact with it and the analysis through
conventional windows features. The 'command line' and 'use file' modes
have been retained for experienced users, or users wishing to explore
new ideas. The 'SCRIPTing' language has been extended to enable full
control and design of the user interface to be handled from ASCII files.

#ZDEFINITIONS AND CONVENTIONS#
#HCdefinition#
#XCommand syntax#
#XSyntax#
#Adefandconv#
#YSyntax of Commands#
#HSsyntax#
 Commands are given to CRYSTALS as small packages, rather like
 sentences. This enables the program to recognise when the user thinks
 that a piece of input
 is complete and then, after inserting any default values and checking
 for errors, perform the task.
#Q
#IFormat of Commands#
#PAll command packages follow the same general format. The command is
 introduced
 with a backslash (or alternatively, a hash symbol) and ends with the
 word 'END'.
#N   5#
#J
      \COMMAND ([keyword=]value ) ...
      (DIRECTIVE ([keyword=]value ) ...)
      END
#
 Items in
 round brackets '()' may be absent, items in square brackets '[]' are
 optional. Ellipsis '...' means the preceding item may be repeated.
#PActual data on a COMMAND or DIRECTIVE line is input in free format,
 with at least one space (or sometimes an optional comma) terminating an
 item. Data items may either be preceded with the keyword and its '=' sign,
 or if the order given in the definition is strictly followed, just by
 the data values. COMMANDS, DIRECTIVES and KEYWORDS can be abbreviated to
 the minimum string which resolves ambiguity.
 Both types of identification can be intermingled.
#PThe following examples are all identical to the program. They use
the command \DISTANCES to compute all interatomic distances in the range
0.0-1.9 Angstrom, and all interatomic angles involving bonds in the range
1.6-2.1 Angstrom.
#N   5#
#J
      \DISTANCE
      SELECT RANGE=LIMITS
      LIMITS DMIN=0.0 DMAX=1.9 AMIN=1.6 AMAX=2.1
      END
#
#N   5#
#J
      \DIS
      SE RA=LI
      LI 0.0 1.9 1.6 2.1
      EN
#
#N   5#
#J
      \DIST
      SEL RANGE=LIM
      LIMI DMAX=1.9 1.6 2.1
      END
#
# Note that in the last example, the value for DMIN is omitted (its
default value turns out to be 0.0) and the list of parameters starts
with a DMAX: CRYSTALS knows that the next parameter is AMIN so it 
need not be specified.
#
#YSyntax of the manual#
#PThose parts of the manual describing data and command input will
 generally be in the following format:
#J
      1. A summary of the complete command, with all directives and
         keywords. Ellipsis (...) may be printed to represent omitted
         but similar parameters.
      2. An typical example. This may not demonstrate all the available
         options
      3. A description of all the directives and keywords.
#
For a simple example, see LIST 1, section #RLIST01#.
#XCommand types#
#YTypes of Commands:#
#HScommands#
#ILists#
#PThese contain related data items, grouped together so that CRYSTALS can
 check
 that the data is complete. These lists are stored in the CRYSTALS
 database. Usually, input of a new list of a given type over-writes an
 existing list of the same type. In general, LISTS do not 'do' anything.
#PThere are two types of syntax for LISTS:
#DKeyed LISTS#
#PIn these, CRYSTALS can know in advance how much and what kind of
 input to expect. Each element of data is identified by an optional
 keyword. See, for example, LIST 1 (section #RLIST01#).
#DLexical LISTS#
#PIn these, CRYSTALS cannot know in advance what kind of data the user
 may wish to input. Each line of input is processed by a lexical scanner,
 and parsed to determine the action needed. See, for example, LIST 12 
 (section #RLIST12#).
#PFor a list of all the lists, see the Lists overview (section #RLISTS#).
#Q
#ICommands#
#PThese cause CRYSTALS to 'do' something, for example, compute a Fourier
 map. There are two type of syntax for commands, similar to those used
 for LISTS:
#DKeyed Commands#
#DLexical Commands#
#Aimmediate#
#IImmediate Commands#
#PThese are special commands which are acted upon immediately they are
 issued. They are never more than one line long, and do not require an
 'END'. They can be issued whenever the cursor is at the beginning of a
 line, even inside a COMMAND or LIST. They are not usually involved with
 the crystallographic calculation, but control some aspect of the way
 CRYSTALS works, such as hooking in an external data file, or changing
 the amount of output produced.
#Q
#IComments#
 Any data line starting with a backslash or hash followed immediately with
 a space is ignored, and may thus be used as a comment, or to deactivate
 the line without deleting it from the file.
#Q
#Q
#IContinuation Lines#
 The directive CONTINUE indicates that the data on the current line is a
 continuation of the previous line.
#
#XImmediate commands#
#YImmediate commands#
#HSimmediate#
#I\FINISH#
#PThis command closes down CRYSTALS neatly.

#I\ ..... COMMENTS ....#
#PThis is a comment line. Column 1 contains the  \  character and
 column 2 _B{must be left blank.
 The remaining columns (3-80) may be used for a descriptive comment.
 Such a comment line may appear at any point in the input.

#I\TITLE ..... A title to be printed .....#
#PThis command changes the title that appears at the start of every
 operation. The characters  \TITLE  are terminated by a space in
 column 7 and the remainder of the line contains the title.

#I\TYPE  'filename'#
#PThe file 'filename' is typed on the users terminal without its contents
 being interpreted by CRYSTALS. Thus \ commands in this file are NOT
 acted on, giving the user a method of previewing a USE file.

#I\USE source#
#PThis command controls the source of commands for CRYSTALS.
 If 'source' is a filename then commands are read from that file.
 If 'source' is LAST ,the current USE file is closed and
 commands are read from the previous level USE file.
 If  'source' is CONTROL  , all USE files open are closed and
 commands are read from the main control
 stream for the job , for example the terminal in an interactive job.
#POne USE
 file may contain other USE commands. The maximum depth of USE
 files  allowed will be installation dependent.
 Note that the USEd file need not be a complete list - it can be as little
 as only one line.
 An indirect file should end with '\USE LAST' , '\USE CONTROL' , or '\FINISH'
 .
 This command is only available in some implementations.
#I\SCRIPT filename#
#PThis command is only available in interactive mode, and passes control
 to the 'script' file, which tries to assist the user by prompting him
 for data and information. A separate manual describes the writing of
 user define scripts.
#I\SPAWN      'shell command'#
#PA 'shell command' can be issued from inside CRYSTALS with this command.
 \SPAWN without a command spawns a sub-process and passes control of the
 sub-process to the terminal. Return to CRYSTALS by closing the
 sub-process.
#I$      'shell command'#
#PA 'shell command' can be issued from inside CRYSTALS with this command.
 Typical examples are: $dir, $notepad, $edit afile, $netscape something.html
#Q
#I\COMMANDS   command#
#PThis command, which takes other command-names as a parameter 
 (without the \ ), produces a listing of the available parameters,
 keywords and defaults for those commands. The listing is
 derived directly from the 'command file', and is thus
 completely up to date for the program being run. This command will
 not operate correctly if the preceding command ended in error. Clear
 the error flag by performing some successful operation.
 The facility
 is an aide-memoire, and not intended to replace the manual.
 The full significance of the output is detailed in section
 #Rcrysdatabase# on the CRYSTALS database.
#I? text#
#PThis facility allows the user to make brief inquiries from the command
 file on the commands, directives, and parameters available at the
 current point in the job. If a command is not being processed, and
 '?' is entered alone, a list of the commands is displayed. If
 '? command'
 is entered, a list of the directives available with that command is
 displayed. If '? command directive' is entered, a list of parameters
 for
 the given command and directive is displayed, and so on.
#PIf a command is currently being processed, the behaviour is similar,
 but no command name is allowed. Then '?' alone gives a list of 
 directives, while '? directive' gives a list of parameters, and so 
 on. In this case care should be taken: After a '?', CRYSTALS loses track
 of the last parameter that was input so using CONTINUE
 will have unpredictable results. To work around this, specify the parameter
 explicitly on the command line, for example:
#J
  \EDIT
  \  Start entering a new atom to be added to the model:
  ATOM U 1.0
  \  Refresh your memory as to the rest of the syntax:
  ?atom
  \  Carry on entering the atom, but give the 
  \ parameter name, X, explicitly.
  CONTINUE X=0.2 0.4 0.5
  END
#
#I\MANUAL  'name'#
#PThe 'name' parameter is the name of the volume whose index is required.
 The
 special name 'INDEX' gives a list of subjects for each volume. The special
 name 'LISTS' gives a list of the function of each LIST.

#I\HELP   'topic'#
#PThe topic 'HELP' contains a list of topics for which help is given. This
 is likely to be very site-specific.
#Q

#I\OPEN devicename filename#
#PThis command is similar to RELEASE, except that a wider range of
 device
 names may be specified, and different messages are produced. An important
 facility available with this command is to open a named HKLI file, for
 the reflection input
 commands HKLI and LIST 6, using the device name HKLI. Similarly permanent
 files may be used in data reduction work by using the device names M32
 and M33
 overriding the default scratch files.
#J
      e.g.
      \OPEN HKLI reflection.hkl

#
#Q

#I\CLOSE devicename #
#PAny file on specified device is closed.

#I\RELEASE  devicename filename#
#PThe file currently open on 'devicename' is closed, and a new file opened
 on that device if necessary. The file just closed can be examined using
 the \TYPE command. The filename parameter is optional. If it is
 specified, the new file will be opened with that name.
#PUseful devices currently available include PRINTER, PUNCH, LOG and MONITOR.

#Q
#I\APPEND devicename filename#
#POutput to the specified device is appended to any output already in
the specified file.
#Q
#IDevice names#
#PDevices are names used inside CRYSTALS to refer
to files that it has opened. Deviecs recognised by CRYSTALS are:
#
# DISCFILE - the database containing everything.
# HKLI     - an hkl file during input using \LIST 6 or \HKLI.
# CONTROL  - commands being input (can be a file if you type
\USE filename, but is usually the command input line)
# PRINTER  - the listing file (bfilenn.lis by default)
# PUNCH    - the punch file (bfilenn.pch by default)
# LOG      - record of all commands issued (bfile.log by default)
# MONITOR  - obsolete, used to be text that appeared on the screen
# SPY      - obsolete, used to collect usage data (locally!).
# NEWDISC  - a second database, open during \PURGE commands.
# COMMANDS - the file commands.dsc defines the syntax and data 
structures of all the commands and lists.
# M32 M33 MT1 MT2 MT3 MTE - scratch files
# SRQ      - system request queue. Some high-level commands 
may issue other CRYSTALS commands using this file.
# FORN1, FORN2 - output of data for 'foreign' (ie. external) 
programs.
# SCPDATA - scripts can read directly from any file opened on
this device (using EXTRACT script command)
# SCP2 - scripts can read directly from any file opened on
this device (using EXTRACT2 script command)s
# SCPQUEUE - stores commands that scripts are building up.
#
Not all may be opened/closed by the user from a command prompt. Some are
only available inside the initialisation file CRYSTSLS.SRC (See STORE
below).

#I\PAUSE interval#
#PThis command causes the program to wait for 'interval' seconds before
 proceding. The maximum value of 'interval' is 200 seconds. It might be
 useful in a 'USE' file.

#I\BENCH nparam nref#
#PThis simulates sfls (structure factor least squares, 
i.e. a cycle of refinement, see #RSFLS#).
to enable processor speeds to be compared. No real
refinement is done, and the structure is not modified.
#J
      nparam defaults to 500
      nref   defaults to 5000
#J
Times for a Microvax 3800 (circa 1995) are printed for comparison.
#Q

#I\SET LIST   state#
#PThis command allows the user to control the monitoring level
 of transfer of lists to and from the database
 in conjunction with the SET WATCH command. There are four states
 available.
#PIf state is OFF, no list logging information is produced.
#PIf state is READ or WRITE, list logging information is only produced
 when lists  are
 read or written respectively.
#PIf state is BOTH, both reading and writing
 operations may be monitored. Note that the logging operation may be qualified
 by a list type specified by SET WATCH. The initial state is WRITE, with
 the
 specific watch set on list 5 (the model parameters), so that only operations 
 creating or modifying list 5 will be monitored.
#I\SET WATCH number#
#PThis command is used in conjunction with SET LIST to control monitoring
 of list operations. If number is 0, operations on all list types may be
 monitored, according to the state set with SET LIST. If number is a positive
 integer, representing a list type, only operations on that list type may
 be
 monitored. The initial value for the list watch is 5, which in conjunction
 with the initial monitoring state means that operations creating or modifying
 list 5 will be monitored.
#I\SET FILE type#
#PThis command is used to control the case of file names generated
 by CRYSTALS. Possible values are:
#N   5#
#J
 LOWER        Filenames are converted to all lower case.
 UPPER        Filenames are converted to all upper case.
 MIXED        Filenames are left as input or defined.
#

#I\SET GENERATE state#
#PThis command is used to control the generation of output file names
 and pseudo-generation numbers on
 non-VMS systems.  By default, CRYSTALS modifies the root of filenames
 for files which should not be overwritten (normally .LIS, .MON, .LOG).
#P OFF suppresses automatic name generation.

#I\SET EXPORT state#
#PIf 'state' is 'on' then LISTS 5 (atoms), 12 (constraints) and 16 
 (restraints) are copied to the PUNCH file
 when CRYSTALS closes down. These can be archived for safety, or exported
 to another computer.

#I\SET UEQUIV state#
 This controls the calculation of Uequiv. Both definitions are acceptable
 to Acta. The arithmetic mean of the principle axes is often similar
 to the refined value of Uiso. The geometric mean is more sensitive to
 long or short axes, and so is more useful in publications.
#J
      ARITH = (U1+U2+U3)/3
      GEOM  = (U1*U2*U3)**1/3
#

#I\SET PAUSE value#
#PThis command sets a time, in seconds, for which the program will pause
 at
 the end of each screen full of output. It is only effective on DOS machines,
 and enables the user to use the 'pause' key to hold a selected screen.
 The maximum value of 'interval' is 200 seconds.
#I\SET LOG state#
#PIf state = ON  then all user input commands are written
 to a log file.
#
If  state = OFF  then subsequent commands are not written
 to the log. Any change made to
 the log state applies only to the current level of USE file and any
 USE file called by it.
 Because the log file is a direct copy of the users commands, it may
 subsequently be used (probably after modification) as a control file.
#I\SET MONITOR state#
#PIf 'state' = ON, then all input is reflected in the monitor file.
 If 'state' = OFF, monitoring.
 is suppressed. Any change made to
 the monitoring state applies only to the current level of USE file and
 any
 USE file called by it.
#I\SET PAGE length#
#PThis command is used to change the length of the assumed 'page' when
 displaying files on the monitor channel, using the commands 'HELP', 'MANUAL',
 and 'TYPE'. The initial length is 20 lines. After the number of lines
 specified have been typed, the listing stops and a message indicates the
 program is waiting. A blank line or carriage return
 at this point will cause the listing to
 continue. Any other input is executed normally. If the length is set to
 zero,
 or a negative number, the feature is disabled.
#I\SET TERMINAL device#
#PThis command controls the display of SCRIPT menus on some
 terminals. Possible device types are
#N   5#
#J
 UNKNOWN This is the default, and requires no special terminal.
 VT52    For use on terminals with limited screen management facilities.
 VT100   For use on advanced terminals.
 VGA     For use on PC VGA terminals
 WIN     For use under Win32 and X-windows.
#
#I\SET COMMUNICATION speed#
#PThis command is used to indicate to the program the speed of the
 communication line or terminal
 on which it is being run. This indication is used by some facilities to
 determine how much output to produce on the monitor channel. The possible
 values for the speed are "SLOW" and "FAST". These keywords are not associated
 with any particular terminal speed, and the appropriate value will depend
 on
 the user's patience. The initial value is "FAST"
#I\SET TIME state#
#PThis command is used to indicate to the program whether the timing
 messages usually produced at the end of each facility are produced. If
 'state'
 is "OFF" the messages are not displayed. If 'state' is "ON" the messages
 are
 displayed.
#I\SET PRINTER state#
#PThis command is used to control output to the 'printer' file. The
 state
 OFF suppresses printer output.
#I\SET OPENMESSAGE state#
#PThis command is used to enable or disable file handling messages.
 OFF suppresses messages.
#I\SET MESSAGE state#
#PThis command is used to indicate to the program whether the command
 messages usually produced at the end of each facility are produced. If
 'state'
 is "OFF" the messages are not displayed. If 'state' is "ON" the messages
 are
 displayed. Error messages are always displayed.
#I\SET SRQ state#
#PThis command is used to control mirroring of CRYSTALS internal commands.
 The normal state OFF suppresses the mirroring.
#
#Q
#YFiles#
#PWhen CRYSTALS runs it stores all crystallographic data in a single file,
by default named crfilev2.dsc. This is a binary file and should not be
opened with any other program.
#PCRYSTALS outputs results and analysis to several places:
#KThe listing file: #
this will be called bfilenn.lis where nn is a number
from 00-99, incremented each time the program is run. When nn reaches 99
this file will be continuously overwritten every time CRYSTALS is run.
#
The listing file contains verbose output about all the calculations that
take place.
#KThe punch file: #
called bfile.pch by default. The idea of 'punching' data
is a throwback to the days of punched cards. This file is used to write out
specific bits of data _i{as _i{commands that can then be read back into the 
program. For example, the parameters defining the crystallographic model 
are stored in CRYSTALS as a 'List 5'. Then 'Punching List 5':
#J
  \PUNCH 5
  END
#
will result in a full \LIST 5 command being written to the file bfile.pch.
You can then recover that version of the model parameters by typing
#J
  \USE bfile.pch
#
which causes the commands written in that file to be executed by CRYSTALS.
#KThe monitor file: #
called bfilenn.mon this is obsolete. If there is any
output in it, it is from a bit of the program that hasn't been looked at
recently.
#KThe log file: #
called bfilenn.log, this contains everything that you typed into CRYSTALS, 
and commands that were issued on your behalf by the menu system or script
processor.
#
#XErrors#
#XWarnings#
#YErrors and Warnings#
#HSerrwarn#
#PCRYSTALS recognises the following run time error categories,
 in addition
 to any detected by the operating system.
#IWarnings#
#PThese will occur only for tasks which produce user-readable
 output, and do not write to the database.
 The current task is abandoned if necessary,
 and the next task fetched from the input stream.
#IErrors#
#PThe error is such that the current task must be abandoned. In batch or
 online modes, the job will be terminated as well. In interactive mode
 the current task is abandoned , and control is returned to the user at
 terminal. The processing of any 'USE' file will be abandoned.
#ISevere Errors#
#PThe error detected is such that it is not possible for the job to
 continue. These errors are usually caused by database management failures.
#ICatastrophic Errors.#
#PThe job is completely terminated.
 This is usualy the consequence of
 errors in reading or writing to the database.
#IProgramming Errors#
#PThe program has detected an inconsistency either in the code, or in
 the command file. A dump and error report will be generated if
 possible. The error and the conditions that cause it should be reported
 to Oxford.
#
#IErrors Detected During the Creation of a LIST#
#PDuring all operations that create new versions of a list, either by
 input or internally, errors may be found that cause the new list not to
 be written to the database. To prevent the system using an old version of
 a list
 when the creation of the latest version has failed, the relevant list
 type
 is marked as an 'error list' in the 'list control table' (see below).
 This error flag is cleared when a new version of the list is created or
 by user action.
#PIf a list which is marked as an error list is accessed, a message will
 be output, and the job terminated. However, for the printing of most lists,
 the error flags are not checked.
#Q
#ZTHE CRYSTALS DATABASE#
#HCdatabase#
#Acrysdatabase#
 It is quite possible to use CRYSTALS so that all the data is read from
 text files at the start of every job (as in SHELXL).
 However, for interactive working, it is preferable to establsh a
 database of crystallographic information which can be used whenever it
 is needed. This database is called the CRYSTALS 'disk' file. It is
 usualy a permanent file on the hard disk, and usually has the extension
 '.DSC'.
#J
 It is a direct-access binary file. DO NOT try to print or edit it.
#PThe data is organised in this file as lists, corresponding to the
 external user-input lists. In modern terminology, these 'lists' 
 would be called 'objects' or 'data structures'. Each list groups
 together related information, e.g. the cell parameters, the atoms, 
 the reflections etc.
# While in general input of a list will
 overwrite a previous version, for the atomic coordinate list (LIST 5, 
 see section #RLIST05#) a
 new version is added to the database. In the event that a refinement
 goes wrong, the user can usually recover an earlier version of the
 structure.
#PIn the  CRYSTALS  system, most of the data required to refine
 a crystal structure must be input to the computer as ASCII,
 translated into an internal format and stored on a random access
 disk file. On the disk, different types of data are recorded
 separately, in what are called  LISTS. Each list holds only one
 type of crystallographic information and is identified by a number
 called the 'list type number'.
#PNormally, each structure uses a separate disk file, which is preserved
 between different jobs and updated whenever a program generates some
 new data. This means that several different versions of a given list
 may be produced during the course of a structure analysis.
 In order that each list may be uniquely identified, every list has
 associated with it a second number, called the 'list serial number'.
 To specify unambiguously a list that is stored in the database,
 it is necessary to know both the relevant list type number
 and the list serial number.
#PIn most cases, however, the version of a given list that is required
 is the latest list of that type to be created.
 Accordingly, an index called the 'current list index' is maintained,
 which contains an entry for the latest version of each list.
 When a program requires information about the current version of a
 list, it accesses the current list index.
#PAs well as an index of the current version of each list,
 a second index is kept, called the 'file index'.
 For each disk file, this latter index contains the information for every
 list that is present in the database.
 This index is always checked when a list is written to the database,
 to ensure that its list type number and list serial number refer to only
 one list.
#PFor a user, the major advantage of splitting the input data into
 logical units in the database is that, for any run, only those lists which
 need to be changed have to be re-input to the database.
 New versions of each list that are generated by programs are
 automatically output to the database so that, provided the database file
 is not
 destroyed or erased, it is probable that each run will contain
 only control commands.
 For example, during a structure factor least squares calculation
 a new set of  Fcalcs  and a new normal matrix will be generated and
 stored in the database ready for further calculations.
#Arichtest#
#POld versions of a list may be reused, provided that they have not been
 overwritten or deleted, by finding the relevant entry in the file index
 and copying it into the current list index.
#P
 The database contains two indices which control access to it.
#ICurrent List Index#
#PThis index contains the serial numbers of each list to be used in
 calculations. This index is updated whenever a list is written to
 database.
#IDisk Index#
#PThis is an index of all the lists contained in the database. When a
 new list is added to the database, its internal address is added to this
 index, and also inserted into the current disk index. It is possible to
 copy address from this index to the current disk index, thus changing
 the currently active version of a list.

      SUMMARY
#
 If  'INDEX'  is  'CURRENT', the current list index is
 printed (i.e. the index containing the current version of each
 list stored).
 If  'INDEX'  is  'DISK', the index containing information about all
 the lists stored on the disk is printed.
 If 'INDEX' is 'SUMMARY', a summary of the usage of the disk file is printed.
#KPUNCH=#
#J

#KLIST=#
#J
      0  -  default value
      n
#
By default (0) all lists are printed or punched. If you specify an
alternative value for the LIST parameter, then only information about
that list number is output.
#AMARKERROR#
#DMARKERROR LIST= SERIAL= RELATIVE= ACTION=#
#PThis directive can either mark a specified type of list as an 'error
 list', or alternatively, such a mark can be removed from the list control
 table.
#KLIST=n#
 'n' is the list type number (there is no default value).
#KSERIAL=n#
 'n' is the list serial number. The default value is zero, which
 represents the serial number of the current list of this type.
#KRELATIVE=n#
 'n' is the offset applied to the serial. The default value
 is 0. If both SERIAL and RELATIVE are zero (the defaults) 
 the current list of the specified type will be 
 the one that is marked.
#KACTION=#
#J
      NO
      YES  -  default value
#
 If  ACTION is  NO , the entry in the list control table for the list type
 specified is altered so that it is not marked as an 'error list'.
 If  ACTION is  YES, the entry in the list control
 table for the list type specified is altered so that it is marked as an
 'error list'. If a program attempts to use such a list, an error is
 reported, and the job terminated.

#DEXTEND RECORDS= FREE= TRIES= SIZE=#
 This directive 
 allows the user to extend the database by a specified number
 of records, and to control the auto-extension. On modern
 platforms the extension of the database is automatic by
 default.
#KRECORDS=#
 This parameter specifies a number of records to be added to the
 file. The default value is zero i.e. no records are added.
#KFREE=#
 This parameter specifies a number of records that must be available
 for use in the file. The file will be extended until there are at
 least 'FREE' records unused after the next free disk address.
#KTRIES=#
 This is the number of times the system may try adding 'SIZE' records to
 the disk file to achieve enough space for the current operation. Usual
      default is 1.
#KSIZE=#
 This is the size, in records, that the system will increase the disk by
 to try to accommodate the current operation. The usual default is 5.
 If the write still fails after TRIES x SIZE records have been added it 
 produces an error. Setting SIZE to zero enables uncontrolled
 extension of the disk file. This is the default, but if the
 user gets carried away doing crystallography, they may fill their 
 disk.
#
#DCHECK#
 This directive checks the integrity of the disk file. It takes
 no parameters.
#KErrors in the DISK file.#
 If CRYSTALS
 reports errors in the disk file, run this utility to get a list of those
 LISTS corrupted. Use \PUNCH 5, \PUNCH 12 and \PUNCH 16 to make ASCII
 copies of these important lists (by default output to the 'punch' 
 file, bfile.pch - rename it after punching to e.g. 'savedlists.pch'). 
 If the final version 
 of a list is corrupt, use \DISK RESET (see above #RRESET#) to point 
 the program 
 to an earlier version and punch that instead.
 If the disk file becomes totally
 unusable, delete it, read in the reflections again, and then read in
 these 'punched' lists (\USE savedlists.pch).
#
 If only certain lists are unusable,
 use the DELETE directive in \DISK to mark defective LISTS for
 deletion, and then use \PURGE NEW to create a new disk file (by 
 default new.dsc). Rename new.dsc to crfilev2.dsc to make CRYSTALS 
 open it by default when it starts in that directory.
#N   4#
#J
 The following lists can always safely be deleted since CRYSTALS creates
 new ones automatically.
# 10 Fourier peaks (section #RLIST10#).
# 11 Normal matrix (section #RLIST11#).
# 20 Saved geometrical transformation matrices (section #RLIST20#).
# 22 Constraints in internal format (section #RLIST22#).

      END
      \  Open a new file save.dat on the 'PUNCH device'.
      \  Release is equivalent to CLOSE followed by OPEN.
      \RELEASE PUNCH SAVE.DAT
      \  Output the important data lists:
      \PUNCH 5

      \FINISH
#
 At this point it would be useful on a stand-alone computer to
 run a system utility (e.g. SCANDISK on a PC) to check the integrity of
 the computers hard disk, since CRYSTALS rarely corrupts the disk itself.
#
 One would then open a command prompt in the working folder and do this:
#J
      del crfilev2.dsc
      ren rescue.dsc crfilev2.dsc
#
 Now restart CRYSTALS in the same folder. Recover the important saved 
 data by typing:
#J
      \USE save.dat

#PThis command deletes all but the current

 and then rewrites the disk file
 so that the space occupied by the old deleted lists is overwritten.
 This operation does not normally shorten the file physically (see parameter
 FILE below for a method of doing this) , but frees
 a lot of space that can be reused.
 The optional parameters 'FILE' and 'INITIALSIZE' (available
 in some implementations
 only), allow the user to create a new file with only the current
 version of each list in it. This file may be smaller than the
 original disk file.

#PThis parameter controls whether a new file is created. If the value
 specified is not OLD, a new file will be created containing only the
 current versions of each list, and any which are marked to be retained.
 The program automatically extends the file to the size required for all
 the lists to be retained. This new file has the extension .DSC,
 and may be used in future CRYSTALS tasks.
#KINITIALSIZE=#
#PThis parameter is used to specify an initial size for a new file. If
 a new file is not to be created, the value is ignored. The default
 value of zero causes the new file to have the smallest size necessary
 to contain all the copied lists.
#KLOG=#

#Q
#IElement Names#
#PElements are specified by a name, called the atom _b{TYPE. The
 'TYPE' is used to associate the refined atoms with atomic properties,
 such as form factors, radii, etc. The TYPE _b{must start with a letter,
 and is not case sensitive.
 REMEMBER that 'blank'
 is used as a delimiter in CRYSTALS and so must
 not appear in an atom TYPE. Elements in the form factor list (LIST 3 - see
 section #RLIST03#)
 and the atomic properties (LIST 29 - section #RLIST29#) are associated by 
 their TYPE with atoms in the parameter list (LIST 5). Numeric properties of the
 elements are pre-prepared in the files SCATT, SCATCU, SCATMO and
 PROPERTI(.dat) in the SCRIPT directory (Often CRYSTALS\SCRIPT). The
 'elements' C', C", H' and H" are in these files with the properties of C and H.
 You can define your own element names, but may not use +,- or *.
#Q
#IAtom names#
 Individual atoms are specified by combining the TYPE with a SERIAL
 number. This is an integer in the range 1-9999. When combined with the
 TYPE, it must be enclosed in parentheses ().
#J
   e.g.   C(2) CL(123)
#
#Q
#ISymmetry equivalent atoms#
#P
 Atoms specified as above correspond exactly to those in the refinable
 atom list (LIST 5). If a symmetry equivalent atom is required, up to 5
 additional items are included inside the parentheses. The full
 specification of an atom is:
#J
       TYPE(SERIAL,S,L,Tx,Ty,Tz)
#
#Q
#DS #
 is the serial number of the symmetry operator in the stored list of
 space group operators. If negative, it indicates that the atom
 coordinates are first negated before being operated upon. The default is
 1
#Q
#DL #
 is the serial number of the non-centring lattice translation to be
 used. The default is 1.
#Q
#DTx,Ty,Yz #
 are whole cell translations parallel to the cell axes. The
 default is 0.
#P
 If the value of an item is its default, it may be omitted altogether, though
 its place must be marked by its associated comma. A series of trailing
 commas may also be omitted. For example:
#N   9#
#J
       C(99,-1,1,0,0,0) - an atom related by inversion at the origin
                          (assuming x,y,z is the first operator).
       C(99,-1,1,,,0)   - same atom as above, omitting defaults.
       C(99,-1)         - same atom as above, omitting 
                          defaults and trailing commas.

 programs which are not part of CRYSTALS, but which provide useful
 functions in providing a complete system. These programs often come
 from other laboratories, and are only distributed with the authors
 permission unless they are public domain. Where practical, we make no
 changes to the original code. We offer little or no support in
 connection with these programs, though usually they are in frequent
 use in Oxford. The linking routine prepares data files for the foreign
 program, and may initiate a subprocess to execute the rogram.

 added to the basic routines. In addition a more flexible method
 of  specifying the unique axis in a monoclinic spacegroup is

#PThe result of inputting a \SPACEGROUP command (section #RSPACEGROUP#) 
is the automatic generation of a 'LIST 2' containing the explicit 
symmetry operators and other information that defines the spacegroup.
#PDirect input of this list enables the user to specify explicitly 
 the symmetry operators to be used. The advantage of this is that 
 they need not comply to any standard convention - the only
 check made by the program is to ensure that the determinant is 
 not zero. For example, this technique may be used to enter a 
 set of symmetry operators that contains a translation of a half along
 an axis - normally that cell length would be halved instead, but it may
 be useful in order to work consistently with a structure that undergoes
 a cell-doubling phase transition.

#PThe CELL directive defines the Bravais lattice type,
 the number of equivalent positions to be input, and whether the
 cell is centric or acentric.
 The equivalent positions are defined by  SYMMETRY  directives, which contain
 one equivalent position each, and must follow the  CELL  directive.
 The equivalent positions input should not include those related
 by a centre of symmetry if the lattice is defined as centric, and should
 not include those related by non-primitive lattice translations if
 the correct Bravais lattice type is given.
 Positions generated by the last two operations are computed by the
 system.
 The unit matrix, defining x, y, z, _b{MUST _b{ALWAYS be input.
 If a centric cell is used in a setting which does not place the centre
 at the origin, then ALL the operators must be given and the cell be
 treated as non-centric. This will of course increase the time for
 structure factor calculations.
#PRhombohedral cells can be treated in two ways. If used with

 This defines the Bragg angle of the monochromator.
 If omitted, a default of 6.05 is assumed, indicating
 that a monochromator was used with Mo radiation
#KTHETA(2)=#
 This defines the angle between the plane of the
 monochromator and the diffracting planes of the crystal.
 If this parameter is omitted, a default value of 90 is assumed.
 This value is not used if  THETA(1)  is zero.
 Since the angle  THETA(2)  is fixed, the Lp correction computed
 using these constants is correct only for experiments where  THETA(2)
 is a constant.
 This is true for equatorial geometry experiments, but is not true
 for equipment that uses Weissenberg or precession geometry.  It is not 
 true for area detector instruments.
#KCONSTANT(1)= CONSTANT(2)= CONSTANT(3)= CONSTANT(4)=#
 These four parameters are used to input fundamental constants
 for the diffractometer used to collect the data.
 How many of the constants, and what values they should have are
 determined by the equipment and its setting.
 To determine the values required, consult your local diffractometer
 expert.
 The default values for c(1), c(2) and c(3) are the Nonius CAD4 GONCON
 constants, and c(4) is the theta value for the change from
 bisecting to fixed chi mode (and has a value of 90 degrees).
 These constants are important when machine geometry dependent
 calculations are made - for example, absorption corrections.
 The defaults in the program were correct for the Nonius CAD4 
 in the Oxford Chemical Crystallography lab on 13 October 1980.

#Q
#DFormat of reflection data#
      The reflection data may be embedded into the control data, but it
 is more normal to hold it in a separate file, the HKLI file. This file
 may have one of more reflections per line, or a reflection may span
 several lines. The parameters for each reflection may be in fixed
 format, _i{i.e. right adjusted columns, or be in free-format, with
 at least a single space separating items.
#PIf fixed-format input is used, the user must supply a FORTRAN format
 statement. This specifies the width of the input fields, where the
 decimal points are, and any fields to be skipped.  Even though the indices
 are usually integer values, CRYSTALS read them as floating point numbers.
 A FORTRAN 'I' format is automatically changed to an 'F' format.
 Note that if the input figures contain decimal points, these will
 over-ride values given in the format statement.

#
#DTermination of reflection data#
 The reflection data themselves should be terminated with  a
 value less than or equal to -512 for the first value on the 
 final input line.
#
 If the reflections are embedded into the control data, then correct
 termination is _b{vital. Incorrect termination may lead to the program
 trying to read commands as reflections, producing massive error files.
 If the reflections are in the HKLI file, most
 implementations will detect the end-of-file and terminate input.
#
#Q
#DF or Fsq?#
 CRYSTALS will accept either F or Fsq observations, signed or unsigned.
 Either quantity is referred to by the name 'Fo'. If sigma values
 are given, they must refer directly to the signed input F or Fsq values.
 reflections are stored as Fo, and standard deviations are
 transformed or approximated so that Least-Squares refinement
 can be performed with either F or Fsq independent of input type. Raw
 intensities, I, can be input with the HKLI command. The reflection
 input routines (LIST 6 or HKLI) are the only routine able to take the
 square root of the observation. See the chapter on refinement for a
 brief discussion of the merits of F and FSQ refinements.
#
#DMerged or unmerged data?#
 CRYSTALS supports two levels of merging (averaging) simultaneously.  
 For Fourier syntheses it is important that all symmetry operations of 
 the Laue Group are applied, including Friedel's Law. For refinement it 
 is permitted to used un-merged data, though in general some merging is 
 performed. For non-centrosymmetric structures containing strong
 anomalous scatterers 
 Friedel pairs should be kept separate, but other symmetry operations 
 should be applied. 
#PThe reflection list with the minimal amount of merging is the 
 principal reflection list, LIST 6 (section #RLIST06#). This can 
 be used to create 
 a full-merged list for Fourier (or other) calculations, LIST 7 
 (section #RLIST07#).
 The user can indicate to most commands which use reflections whether 
 to use LIST 6 or LIST 7, but by default all use LIST 6 for backwards 
 compatibility. 
#When working from the menus, CRYSTALS tries to determine whether a LIST 
 6 or a LIST 7 would be most appropriate.  If a LIST 7 is required, the 
 SCRIPT COPY67 is activated to output a LIST 6 as a temporary file, and 
 re-input it as a LIST 7.  This can then be manupulated independently of 
 the original LIST 6.
#LIST 7s are currenlty automatically created for:
#J
      Fourier Maps
      Slant Fourier Maps
      Superflip Structure Solution
      The Hooft/Straver/Spek configuration parameter

#PThis directive allows the user to define a format statement if
 fixed format input is being used.
 This directive is only valid if the  TYPE  parameter on the  READ

#KEXPRESSION=#
 This parameter defines the format to be used.
 Normally this keyword is omitted, so that the directive looks
 like a FORTRAN format statement, except that there must be at least
 one space between the  'FORMAT' and the expression, to terminate the
 directive.
 Since all the data are read as real numbers, the format expression
 can only contain F , E , and X field definitions - either find a good
 Fortran reference book for examples, or ask someone who did 
 crystallography before 1990.

#DMATRIX M11= M12= ...M33= TOLER= TWINTOLER=#
#PThis directive inputs a matrix to be applied to the reflection indices

TOLER from an integer, the reflection is rejected. TWINTOLER is a value,
in A-2, for overlap of potentially twinned reflections. See the chapter
on twinning (#Rtwinning#).
#KMij=#
 The 9 elements (by row) of an index transformation matrix. The default
is a unit matrix
#KTOLER=#
 The reflection is rejected if any transformed index differs from an
integer by more than TOLER. The default is 0.1.
#KTWINTOLER=#
 The twin element tag is updated if the generated reciprocal lattice
point differs from a base lattice point by less than TWINTOLER
reciprocal Angstrom. The default is 0.001, but an ideal value will depend
upon the integration method, the mosaicity, and the lengths of the cell
edges.

#YReflection Parameter Coefficients#
#AREFPARCOEF#
#HSrefparamcoeff#
#PCRYSTALS has a very flexible procedure for storing reflection
 information, enabling the user to optimise disk space use. The user
 must indicate to the program what information is available in the input
 data, and what information is to be stored. Storage space may also be
 reserved for data yet to be computed.
#PDuring data reduction (section #RDATAREDUC#), space is reserved for 
 relevant coefficients.
 These coefficients (_i{e.g. setting angles) may not be needed during
 structure analysis, so they are not normally preserved beyond reduction.

#DRefinement using a partial model#
#PIf the user is experiencing difficulties with a small part of an otherwise
 well behaved large structure, the real and imaginary parts of the
 structure factors due to the well behaved part can be precomputed and
 stored and these atoms removed from the atom list (LIST 5).
 The user then only needs recompute the contributions
 from the varying fragment. The total Fo, Fc, real and imaginary parts are
 stored with the keys

#Q
#YStorage of reflection data#
#ASTOREREF#
#HSstore6#
#PReflections may be stored either in the structure database (the DSC
 file), or as external binary serial files. The latter is used mainly
 during data reduction (section #RDATAREDUC#).
#PWhen a change is made to most other
 data lists, they are either completely overwritten (LIST1, cell
 parameters), or a new list created in addition to the old list (LIST 5,
 atom parameters). Because the reflections are special, they are handled
 differently. A small piece of information (called the LIST 6 Header) is
 created to hold information about the rest of the reflection list,
 and new headers are stored each time the main body is updated. The main
 body of the reflection list is modified in-situ if the only changes are
 ones which can easily be recomputed ( _i{e.g. Fc, phase, sqrtw), thus
 reducing the disk activity. If an error occurs during the updating of
 the body, the list becomes inaccessible to other processes, and the
 failing process must be re-run correctly.
 If the changes involve a change in size of
 the list, then a new body is created.
#PDuring raw data processing (Data reduction, section #RDATAREDUC#) the 
 size of the reflection
 list can change a lot (coefficients being added or removed, reflections
 being merged or rejected). To prevent the .DSC file growing too large,
 binary serial files are used to hold the body of the reflection list.
 One is used for input and one for output at each stage, the roles being
 reversed after each stage. The header is kept in the .DSC file, and
 keeps track of the bodies. When data reduction is complete, the body
 must be copied to the .DSC file as follows:
#N   4#
#J
 \  After data reduction, make a final copy of the reflections
 \  and STORE THEM IN THE .DSC FILE:
 \LIST 6
 READ TYPE=COPY
 END
#
#Q
#YCompressed reflection data#
#HScompress6#
#PCRYSTALS can produce files containing reflections is a 'compressed'
 format. This might be useful for archiving data. The compressed data is
 headed by the correct information for its reinput.
#PThe file contains information for  h, k, l, /FO/ or /FOT/, RATIO/JCODE
 and elements.
 For each  KL  pair, the  K  value is given for this group of
 reflections, then the  L  value for the group, followed by
 the  H  and /FO/ and other values for the first reflection, the  H   /FO/
 and other values for
 the second reflection, and so on, finishing with 512, which is the
 terminator for this  KL  pair.
 This pattern is repeated for all the  KL  pairs, the terminator
 for the last  KL  pair being -512, and indicates the end of the reflection
 list. Take care if you try to edit these files, and
 note that  K  and  L  are the two constant indices for each group,
 while  H  changes most rapidly.

#PIf each reflection has been assigned a serial number (or some other
 incrementing value, such as total X-ray exposure time) then CRYSTALS can
 apply a correction which is linked to this value. The corrections, on the
 scale of Fsq, are held in LIST 27. Two correction factors can be stored,
 but only one used. For example, these can be the actual corrections computed
 from the decay of the standard reflections, and those obtained from
 a 3-point smoothing of the same correction data.
 The applied scale factor is obtained by interpolating between those given
 scale factors with serial numbers above and below the serial number of
 the current reflection.
 If there is a dramatic change in scale (for example due to remeasurement
 of some very strong reflections with attenuated X-rays), it is important
 not to interpolate over this discontinuity. To achieve this, a dummy
 scale factor is inserted at this point with scale values the same as the
 current scales, but with the same serial number as the first scales
 after the discontinuity - for example:

 It is important _b{NOT to use Friedel's Law for structures which have
 strong anomalous scatterers,
 since reflections related by Friedel's law are not
 equivalent in this case and should not be merged together.
 Similarly, if orientation dependent corrections are to be made (_i{e.g.
 DIFABS),original indices should be preserved. Note that in this case,
 only exactly equivalent reflections will be merged, and care must be
 taken when computing Fourier maps. See the sections on Fourier maps,

#PThe merge routine takes a list of
 reflections and combines groups of adjacent reflections with
 _i{exactly the same indices to
 produce a single mean structure amplitude.
#P\SYST (section #RSYSTEMATIC#) and \SORT (section #RSORT#) produce 
 a suitable list, and if
 either of them have been omitted, it is extremely
 likely that the list of reflections produced by the merge process
 will contain duplicated entries for certain reflections.
#PIt is possible to combine equivalent
 reflections in several different ways, depending upon how each
 individual contributor is weighted when the mean is computed.
 Several different weighting schemes are provided, and these are described
 in the next section (the  WEIGHT  directive).
#PThe JCODE key in the list of reflections may be input from some
 diffractometers (e.g. a CAD4) to indicate that the value may be
 inaccurate. Reflections which have JCODES that differ from unity 
 are thought
 to be inaccurate and can be down-weighted or eliminated during the merge
 process (the  JCODE  directive). Note that JCODES MUST be positive
 and less than 10.
#PAlthough under normal circumstances LIST 6 (reflections) contains /Fo/
 data rather than /Fo/**2 data, the calculations performed during
 the merge are done on the scale of /Fo/**2.
 This means that r-values are computed which refer to /Fo/**2,
 and that reflections can be rejected on the basis of the
 ratio of /Fo/**2 to its standard deviation.
 If for some reason the LIST 6 contains /Fo/**2 data rather
 than the normal /Fo/ data, it is necessary to use the "F's"
 parameter of the "REFLECTIONS" directive to inform the system 
 of this fact.
#PDuring the merge process, the system calculates and then prints a
 set of merging r-values, which are defined as follows :
#N  14#
#J
 R = 100*SUM[ Sd(i) ]/SUM[ M(i) ],
             where 'i' runs over all reflections.


 Sd(i) = SUM[ <Fsq(i)> - Fsq(j) ],
             summed over 'j' contributors.

 and

 M(i) = SUM[ <Fsq(i)> ],
            summed 'j' times for 'j' contributors.
#
 The sum variable  'i'  runs over all the reflections produced by the merge
 process which have more than one contributor.
 The sum variable  'j'  runs over all the contributors for each reflection
 produced by the merge process.
  <Fsq(I)>  is the mean value for the reflection  'i' , while  Fsq(j)  is
 the observed value of Fsq for the contributor  'j'.
#PIf the crystal is twinned, this will affect the merge. See chapter 
#Atwinning# on twinned crystals
#PIf the data is in Batches with different BATCH scale factors, this will

#Q
#IWEIGHTING SCHEMES FOR THE DATA MERGE#
#PAt present there are three different weighting schemes available
 for merging equivalent reflections.
 These are :
#N   4#
#J
      1.      Each reflection is given equal weight (unit weights).
      2.      Weights based on a Gaussian distribution.
      3.      W(i) = 1.0/Sigma(i)**2  for each reflection.
#
#PUnit and statistical weights (schemes 1 and 3) are more or less
 equivalent unless some reflections have been remeasured under very
 different regimes ( _i{e.g. with an attenuator set, mA turned down,
 different crystal)
#PScheme 2 is designed to discriminate against outliers, _i{i.e.
 reflections lying farther from the mean than might be expected.

 For this scheme, a weighted mean value of Fsq is determined
 iteratively, starting from unit weights.
 At each iteration, the weights are recomputed to discriminate against
 outliers and  the contributing reflections are given a new
 weight w(i) given by :
#N  14#
#J
      w(i) = exp [ (-log(a) * q(i)**2)/(b**2 * e(i)**2) ]

 Where

     q(i)  is the deviation of the particular Fsq(i) from the current average.
     e(i)  is a predicted mean deviation of the reflection 'i' from the
           current mean and is given by a function similar to that used
           in Least Squares :
#
 e = c + d*Sig(Fsq) + g*Sig(Fsq)*/Fo/ + h*Sig(Fsq)*Fsq
#
 a,b,c,d,g,h  are 6 input parameters provided by the user
#
 'a'  and  'b' define the Gaussian distribution.
#
 'a'  is the weight to be given to a reflection which has a
 deviation given by 'q(i) = b*e(i)'.
#
 Suggested values of  'a'  and  'b'  are  0.5 and 3.0 respectively,
 so that if for example, 'e(i) = 3*Sig(Fsq)' (d=3, c=g=h=0),
 a deviation  q(i)  of  6*Sig*fsq  will assign a reflection a
 weight of 0.5.
#
  'c'  Provides the bias necessary to allow for
 failures in the counting statistics at low count
 rates.
#
  'd'  is a scaling constant.
#
  'g'  and  'h'  allow for the increased dispersion of strong reflections.
#N   3#
#J
 For a conventional diffractometer, suggested values for the parameters are :

      a = .5      b=3.0      c=1.0      d=2.0      g=.01      h=.00001
#
#PIt is recommended that the Gaussian scheme be used, as it discriminates
 against zero or widely dispersed intensities very efficiently.
#Q
#IStandard deviations produced by the merge#
#PAfter the equivalent reflections have been merged
 two different standard deviations
 are computed and can be output :
#N   9#
#J
 SIGMA1 = Sqrt (sum [ w(i)*q(i)**2 ] / n * sum [ w(i) ])
             that is, the weighted r.m.s. deviation.

 SIGMA2 = Sqrt (sum [ w(i)*s(i)**2 ] / n * sum [ w(i) ])
             that is, the weighted average standard deviation.
#
 Either of these two standard deviations can be selected as an estimate
 of Sigma(Fsq), and perhaps be converted to a Least Squares weight. If a
 reflection is measured very many times, SIGMA1 should be similar to
 SIGMA2. It is almost always much greater.

#XAtom name syntax#
#YSpecifications of atoms and other parameters#
#HSatomspec#
#PThere is a consistent syntax thoughout CRYSTALS for refering to atoms
 and atomic parameters. This was referred to briefly in Chapter 1, and
 will be defined more fully here.
#Q
#IATOM SPECIFICATION#
#PThere are three different but related ways of specifying an atom
 or a group of atoms.
#DTYPE(SERIAL,S,L,TX,TY,TZ)#
#PThis specification defines one atom.
 The various parts of the expression are :
#KTYPE#
 The atom type, defined in Chapter 1 in the section on form-factors.
#KSERIAL#
 The serial number, in the range 1-9999
#KChecking of serial numbers#
#PAtoms of the same type are distinguished from one another by having
 different serial numbers. However, at no stage is a check made to ensure
 that there is not more than one atom in LIST 5 (atomic parameters) with 
 the same type and
 serial number. If a routine is searching for an atom with a given type
 and serial number, the first atom found will always be taken, and any
 subsequent atoms with the same type and serial number will be ignored.
#PSerial numbers are considered to be different if they differ from
 each other by more than 0.0005.

#KS#
 'S' specifies a symmetry operator provided
 in the unit cell symmetry LIST (LIST 2 - see section #RLIST02#).
 'S' may take any value between '-NSYM' and
 '+NSYM', except zero, where 'NSYM' is the
 number of symmetry equivalent positions
 provided in LIST 2.
 if 'S' is less than zero, the coordinates
 of the atom stored in LIST 5 are negated (i.e.
 inverted through a centre of symmetry at
 the origin) and then multiplied by the
 operator specified by the absolute value of
 'S' to generate the new atomic coordinates.
 'S' may be less than zero even if the space
 group is non-centrosymmetric ( _I{i.e. introduce a false centre),
 but must not be greater than 'NSYM'.
 The default value for 'S' is '1', specifying the
 first matrix in LIST 2, usually the unit matrix.

#KL#
 'L' specifies the non-primitive lattice translation
 that is to be added after the coordinates have been
 modified by the operations given by 'S'.
 'L' must not be greater than the number of allowed
 non-primitive translations in the space group.
 The translations provided by 'L' depend on
 the lattice type and are given by :
#N  17#
#J
          L=    1             2                3                4

      P       0,0,0
      I       0,0,0      1/2,1/2,1/2
      R       0,0,0      1/3,2/3,2/3      2/3,1/3,1/3
      F       0,0,0        0,1/2,1/2      1/2, 0 ,1/2      1/2,1/2,0
      A       0,0,0        0,1/2,1/2
      B       0,0,0      1/2, 0 ,1/2
      C       0,0,0      1/2,1/2, 0
#
        the default value of 'L' is '1', specifying no
        non-primitve lattice translation.

#KTX,TY,TZ#
 Unit cell translation along the x,y and z directions.
#
 The unit cell translations are added to the
 coordinates after the 'S' and 'L' operations
 have been performed.
 The translations may be positive or
 negative, but must refer to complete
 unit cell shifts.
 The default values for 'TX', 'TY' and 'TZ'
 are all zero, giving no unit cell translations.
#
 The symmetry operations are applied in the order :
#N  11#
#J
      1.  Centre of symmetry if 'S' negative
      2.  Symmetry operator 'S'
      3.  Non-primitve lattice translation
      4.  Whole unit cell translations 'T(X)', 'T(Y)', 'T(Z)'.

    i.e.
           X'=  [R(s)](+X) + t(s) + L + T(X) + T(Y) + T(Z)
    or
           X'=  [R(s)](-X) + t(s) + L + T(X) + T(Y) + T(Z)
#
#PThe format given above is a complete atom definition.
 For convenience the definition may sometimes be shortened.
 The obligatory parts are the  TYPE  and  SERIAL.
 The remaining parameters, S,  L,  TX,  TY, TZ, are optional.
#PAn optional parameter taking its default value
 may be omitted, though its place must be marked by its associated
 comma. A series of trailing commas may be omitted.
#PThe following are all equivalent :
#N   4#
#J
      TYPE(SERIAL,1,1,0,0,0)
      TYPE(SERIAL,,,0,0,0)
      TYPE(SERIAL,1,,,,0)
      TYPE(SERIAL,,,,,)
#
#PThe values of  S ,  L ,  TX ,  TY  and  TZ  are exactly those
 output and used by the distance angles routines under the headings
  S(I) ,  L ,  T(X) ,  T(Y)  and  T(Z)  respectively.
 (See the section of the user guide on 'results of refinement').
#PWhen the symmetry operators are applied, the actual values
 of  S  and  L  are checked to see that they are reasonable.
 If the values found are not reasonable, an error message will
 be output and the job terminated.
#PIn some cases, the symmetry operators are accepted on input,
 but not used by the routine. The description of the routine will state this.
#
#DUNTIL sequences#
 When a group of atoms lie sequentially in the atom parameter list,
 there is an abbreviated way to refer to the group.
#J
      TYPE1(SERIAL1,S,L,TX,TY,TZ)  UNTIL  TYPE2(SERIAL2)
#
#PThis definition specifies all the
 atoms in the current list starting with the atom TYPE1(SERIAL1)
 The first atom in the specification must  occur before the second atom
 in the current parameter list,
 otherwise an error message will be output and the task aborted.
 If symmetry operators are used, they must be given for the first atom
 of the sequence, and will be appied to all  the atoms in the sequence.
#
#J
      Examples

                  C(1) until C(6)

      Six atoms lying around a centre of symmetry:

                  C(1) until C(3) C(1,-1) UNTIL C(3)
#
#DFIRST   AND   LAST#
#PThese specifications each define one atom.   FIRST  Refers to the
 first atom stored in LIST 5 (the model parameters) or LIST 10
 (Fourier peaks), and  LAST  refers to the last atom in the
 list. If these are used as atom designators, no serial number may be given,
 but symmetry operators may be. They may be used in until sequences.
#N   4#
#J
      examples
                  LAST
                  FIRST(x)
                  FIRST(-1) UNTIL C(16)  C(23) UNTIL LAST
#
#DALL#
#PThis specifies all atoms in the list, can take symmetry
 operators or parameter names, but cannot be accompanied on the same line
 by any other atom specifiers.
#N   4#
#J
      examples
                  ALL
                  ALL(x)
                  ALL(-1)
#
#DRESIDUE#
#PThis specifies all atoms or parameters with the given residue number.
#N   4#
#J
      examples
                  RESIDUE(3)
                  RESIDUE(3,X's)
#
#DPART#
#PThis specifies all atoms or parameters with the given part number.
#N   4#
#J
      examples
                  PART(3001)
                  PART(3001,X's)
#
The part number is constructed from two values, the assembly number and
the group number.
#J
    PART NO. = 1000 * ASSEMBLY NO. + GROUP NO.
#
#
The assembly number is normally zero, but a value
can be given to all atoms that are involved in a particular disordered
area of the structure. E.g. on a disordered methyl all the H atoms could
be placed in assembly number 1.
#
The group number within an assembly groups together those atoms which
are simultaneously occupied. E.g. on a disordered methyl, all the H atoms
approximately 109 degrees apart would be given the same group number.
#
The part and group numbers affect the default bonds that are determined
by CRYSTALS, and subsequently output in the CIF or summary file. Some
bonding rules are applied in the following order of priority:
#J
1. An atom in assembly 0, group 0, will bond to any other nearby atom.
2. Atoms in the same assembly, but with different, non-zero group numbers
   will not bond to each other.
3. Atoms in different assemblies with one zero group number
   will not bond to each other.
4. Atoms in the same assembly and group, but with a negative group number
   will not bond to symmetry related atoms in the same assembly and group.
5. All remaining close contacts will be bonded together.
#
Rule 3 may be ignored unless you're trying to set up something very
special. Rule 4 is useful if you have a group disordered across a
symmetry element.
#
Finally, you can select all atoms in a given part of group by using the number 999 as a wild-card.
#N   4#
#J
      examples
                  PART(3999,X's)
      selects all atoms in assembly 3.
#
#
#DHPART#
#PThis specifies all hydrogen (or deuterium) atoms or parameters with the given part number.
#N   4#
#J
      examples
                  HPART(3001)
                  HPART(3001,X's)
#
#DNHPART#
#PThis specifies all non-hydrogen (and deuterium) atoms or parameters with the given part number.
#N   4#
#J
      examples
                  NHPART(3001)
                  NHPART(3001,X's)
#
#DTYPE#
#PThis enable all atoms or parameters on atoms of the given type to be 
processed together.
#J
      example
      /EDIT
      RESET 9900 PART TYPE(H)
      END
#
#PThis puts all the hydrogen atoms into PART(9900). Since all other 
atoms are in PART(0) or a specified PART, the hydrogen will now be 
treated independently.
#

#Q
#IATOMIC PARAMETER SPECIFICATION#
#PAtomic parameters have a NAME. Some directives permit the use of the
 parameter name by itself, which implies that parameter for all atoms.
 The parameter name may be combined with an atom specifier, in which case
 only the parameter for that atom (or group in an UNTIL sequence) is
 referenced. Symmetry operators may be used. The normal drop-out rules
 apply.
#DParameter NAMES#
#PThe following NAMES are recognised.

                     The anisotropic temperature factors for all atoms
                     up to C(23).
#
#DTemperature factor definitions#
#KIsotropic temperature factor#
#J
 The isotropic temperature factor is defined by:

       T = exp(-8*pi*pi*U[iso]*s**2)
                                       where s = sin(theta)/lambda
#
#KAnisotropic Temperature Factor#
#J
      The anisotropic temperature factor (adp) is defined by:

       T = exp(-2*pi*pi*(h*h*a'*a*u[11]
                        +k*k*b'*b'*u[22]
                        +l*l*c'*c'*u[33]
                    +2.0*k*l*b'*c'*u[23]
                    +2.0*h*l*a'*c'*u[13]
                    +2.0*h*k*a'*b'*u[12])).
                                       where x' are the reciprocal
                                       cell parameters and h, k and
                                       l are the Miller indices
#KUequiv#
#PCRYSTALS contains two definitions od Uequiv. Both definitions are acceptable
 to Acta. The arithmetic mean of the principle axes is often similar
 to the refined value of Uiso. The geometric mean is more sensitive to
 long or short axes, and so is more useful in publications. Ugeom is the
 sphere with the same volume as the ellipsoid.
#J
      U(arith) = (U1+U2+U3)/3
      U(geom)  = (U1*U2*U3)**1/3
                                    Where Ui are the principal axes of
                                    the orthogonalised tensor.
#
#Q
 _B{CAUTION
#PIt should be noted that if a set of anisotropic atoms are input with
 the
  FLAG  key set to anything but 0, then the parameters will be
interpreted as Isotropic atoms, or special shapes.
#Q
#DUequiv#
      Two expressions are available for the equivalent temperature factor
 (the geometric or arithmetric mean of the principal components).
 The Immediate Command 'SET UEQUIV' sets which definition will be used.

#N  10#
#J
      Ugeom  = (Ui * Uj * Uk)**1/3

      Uarith = (Ui + Uj + Uk)/3
                                       Where Ui, Uj & Uk are the
                                       principal components of U

      Ugeom is the radius of the sphere with the same volume as the adp
      ellipsoid, and thus gives a good indication of the quality of the
      ellipsoid. Uarith is often closer to the value of Uiso, and so is
      useful for returning to an isotropic refinement.

#

The value of 'FLAG' is used on input of atoms to indicate what kind of
patameters will follow, and is used during calculations for the
interpretation of the parameters.

#KFLAG interpretation#
The following table shows the interpretation of the FLAG parameter.
#J

FLAG  meaning    parameters
'old' types of atoms:

 0    Aniso ADP  u[11]  u[22] u[33] u[23] u[13] u[12]
 1    Iso ADP    U[ISO]

 3    Line       U[ISO] SIZE  DECLINAT AZIMUTH
 4    Ring       U[ISO] SIZE  DECLINAT AZIMUTH

#

#PThe parameters have the following meaning for the new special shapes:
#KSpecial U[iso]#
U[iso] is related to the 'thickness' of the line, annulus or shell.
#DSpecial SIZE#
SIZE is the length of the line, or the radius of the annulus or shell.
#KSpecial DECLINAT#
DECLINAT is the declination angle between the line axis or annulus normal and the
  _i{z
axis of the usual CRYSTALS orthogonal coordinate system, in
degrees/100.
#KSpecial AZIMUTH#
AZIMUTH is the azimuthal angle between the projection of the
line axis or annulus normal onto the _i{x - _i{y plane and the _i{x
axis of the usual CRYSTALS orthogonal coordinate system, in
degrees/100.

#PIf either of these angles is input with a value greater than 5.0, it
is assumed that the user has forgotten to divide by 100, which is thus
done automatically.
#
#Q
#IOVERALL PARAMETER SPECIFICATION#
#POverall parameters are specified simply by their keys.
 The following overall parameter keys may be given :
#N   2#
#J
      SCALE      OU[ISO]      DU[ISO]      POLARITY
      ENANTIO    EXTPARAM
#
#KSCALE#
 This parameter defines the overall scale factor and has a default value
 of unity.
 It is the number by which /FC/ must be multiplied to put
 it onto the scale of /FO/, i.e. /Fo/ = scale*/FC/.
#KDU[ISO]#
 This parameter is the dummy overall isotropic temperature factor and has
 a default value of 0.05.
#PThe dummy overall temperature factor is in no way related to the overall
 temperature factor, and its use is explained in the input of LIST 12,
 which comes in the section of the user guide on 'structure factors'.
#KOU[ISO]#
 This parameter is the overall isotropic temperature factor and has a default
 value of 0.05.
#KPOLARITY#
 This is the Rogers _I{eta parameter, and  is a  multiplier for the
 imaginary part of the anomalous
 scattering factor.
 Setting the value to 1.0 (its default) has the effect of using the
 imaginary part
 of the anomalous scattering factor as given.
 Changing the value to
 -1.0 has the effect of changing the hand of the model. Setting the value
 at zero has the effect of removing the contribution of f". However, if
 contributions from f" are not required, IT IS MORE EFFICIENT to set ANOMALOUS
 = NO in LIST 23 (structure factor control, see section #RLIST23#). If you 
 need to use f", remember not to
 apply Friedel's law (LIST 13, section #RLIST13#) during data reduction
 (section #RDATAREDUC#),
 and to include anomalous scattering (LIST 3, section #RLIST03# and
 LIST 23, section #RLIST23#). See D. Rogers, Acta Cryst (1981), 
 A37,734-741. _I{POLARITY
 _I{and _I{ENANTIO _I{should _I{not _I{be _I{used _I{simultaniously.
#KENANTIO#
 This overall parameter is the fractional contribution of F(-h) to the observed
 structure amplitude, and like the POLARITY parameter is sensitive to the
 polarity of the structure. It is defined by
#J
       Fo**2 =(1-x)* F(h)**2 + x*F(-h)**2
#
 where x is the ENANTIOpole parameter. A value of 0.0 means the structure
 stored in LIST 5 is of the correct hand. A value of 1.0 inverts the structure.
 Its effect on the structure factor is switched on or off by the parameter
 ENANTIO in LIST 23 (see section #RLIST23#). Computations are more efficient 
 when it is turned off.
 If the enantiopole is used (or refined) then Friedel's law must not be applied
 (LIST 13, section #RLIST13#) and anomaloue scattering must 
 be included (LIST 13 and LIST 23).
 See Howard Flack, Acta Cryst, 1983, A39, 876-881. This parameter
 is more robust than the POLARITY parameter.
 See also section in Results.
#KEXTPARAM#
 This parameter is Larson's extinction parameter , r*, (equation 22 in
   A.C. Larson, Crystallographic Computing, 1970, 291-294, ed F.R.
 Ahmed, Munksgaard, Copenhagen , but with V
 replaced by the cell volume)
 and has a default value of zero.
#PNote that many other programs use expression (4),
  which cannot cope with Neutron data, and  gives a value for 'g'
  which is about 1,000,000 times smaller than 'r*'.
#N   3#
#J
       g ~= [(e**2/mc**2)**2 . lambda**3/V**2 . Tbar ] . r*
#
 Tbar is the absorption weighted mean path length, and is assumed to be
 stored in
 LIST 6 (section #RLIST06#) with a key of  TBAR . If this key is 
 absent, a default value of 1.0
 is used. If extinction is to be included in the model, the mosaic spread
 should have been set in LIST 13 (section #RLIST13#).

#KSERIAL=#
 The atoms serial number. There is no default value.
#KOCC=#
 This parameter defines the site occupancy _B{EXCLUDING special position
 effects (i.e. is the 'chemical occupancy). The default is 1.0.
 Special position  effects are computed by CRYSTALS and multiplied onto
 this parameter.
#KFLAG=#
 This parameter specifies the type of temperature factor for the atom,
 and if it is omitted a default value of 1 is assumed. _B{NOTE that it
 _B{must be set to 0 for anisotropic atoms.
#KX= Y= Z=#
 These parameters specify the atomic coordinates for the atom, for which
 there are no default values.

 These parameters have different interpretations depending upon the
value of FLAG
#P
 If FLAG=0
#P These parameters specify the anisotropic temperature factors for the atom
 and if they are omitted default values of zero are assumed.
 The order of the
 cross terms is obtained by dropping 1,2,3 sequentially from [123].
#P

U[iso] is related to the 'thickness' of the line, annulus or shell.
#DSpecial SIZE#
SIZE is the length of the line, or the radius of the annulus or shell.
#KSpecial DECLINAT#
DECLINAT is the declination angle between the line axis or annulus normal and the
  _i{z
axis of the usual CRYSTALS orthogonal coordinate system, in
degrees/100.
#KSpecial AZIMUTH#
AZIMUTH is the azimuthal angle between the projection of the
line axis or annulus normal onto the _i{x - _i{y plane and the _i{x
axis of the usual CRYSTALS orthogonal coordinate system, in
degrees/100.

#PIf either of these angles is input with a value greater than 5.0, it
is assumed that the user has forgotten to divide by 100, which is thus
done automatically.

#Q

#PThis is a powerful crystallographic editor for
 modifying a LIST 5 (the model parameters) or LIST 10 (Fourier peaks).
 It offers the editing facilities frequently needed
 for the management of atom parameters, including conditional operations
 and arithmetic.
#
#PEDIT is a semi-interactive command, in that each directive is
 computed as soon as its input is complete. Since CONTINUE can be used
 to extend a directive over several lines, completion is indicated be
 the start of a new directive, or the special directive EXECUTE.
#PAfter the terminating END, the resulting list is
 output to the disc.
 However if the list has not been changed, a new list will be created only
 if the list type is being changed ( e.g. 10 to 5 ).
 The current edited version of the list can be saved at
 any time to protect against future editing mistakes ( the SAVE directive ).
 It is also possible to abandon editing without creating a new list ( the QUIT
 directive ).
#PWhen used in interactive mode, a new list is created even though errors may
 have occured during command input unless the QUIT directive is used. In
 online and batch modes no new list will be created if errors occured
 during the edit. In this case an error message in generated.
#PTake care to note that some directives refer to atom or group of atoms,
 others refer to one or more parameters, and two
 (CHANGE  and  SELECT)will refer to either an atom specification
 or a parameter specification.
 Although atom definitions can include a series of symmetry operators,
 the only directives that will use them are those
 for which the subsequent description explicitly states that the
 symmetry operators are used.
 In all other cases, the symmetry information will be read in without any
 error messages and ignored.
 Those operations which require a single parameter type as argument
 (ADD,  MULTIPLY  etc ) will fail if composite parameters ( "U'S", etc )
 are given.

#DEND#
 This should be the last directive in the set of modification directives.
#DEXECUTE#
 This directive which has no parameters does nothing to the edited list. It
 is provided to allow the user to see the results of one operation (
 initiated by the directive whose input is terminated by EXECUTE ) before
 attempting the next.
#DSAVE#
 Forces the current atom list to be writen to disk.
#DQUIT#
 This directive will cause the edit to be abandoned without the creation
 of a new list if it is followed by
 END . If it is followed by any other directive it is ignored.
#P
#DMONITOR LEVEL#
 This directive controls the level of monitoring of editing operations. When
 each operation is performed, the results can be monitored in the monitor
 channel and in the listing file. Four levels of monitoring are provided. The
 inital level and the default level used when no value is specified is
 'MEDIUM'. The possible values of the parameter 'level' are :-
#N   8#
#J
      OFF          No monitoring occurs
      LOW          Type and serial only are displayed
      MEDIUM       Program selects level of display   (default)
      HIGH         At least the level represented by
                   'MEDIUM' listing is displayed
#
#PWhen the program selects a monitor level account is taken of the
 amount of relevant information for the particular directive. Thus for
 DELETE only 'type' and 'serial' need be displayed whereas for CHANGE
 all parameter values are displayed.
#DLIST LEVEL#
 This directive produces a list of the current edited list in the monitor
 output stream and in the listing file. If KEEP has been used, the atoms
 which will be kept are indicated.
 The possible values for 'level' are :-
#N   7#
#J
      OFF               No listing produced
      LOW               Type and serial listed
      MEDIUM            Type , serial , occ , u[iso] ,
                        x , y , z listed
      HIGH              All atomic parameters listed
#
#DDELETE  ATOM SPECIFICATIONS  .  .#
 All the specified atoms are removed
 from the current atomic parameter list.
 Deleted atoms should not be referenced by subsequent directives.
#DATOM TYPE SERIAL OCC FLAG X Y Z U11 ..#
 This directive causes the system to add an atom to the
 end of the edited list. The format is the same as that used in \LIST 5 (see
section #RLIST05#).
 Values must be provided for 'type' , 'serial' , 'x' , 'y' , and 'z' .
 Default values are provided for the other parameters as in \LIST 5.
 Example :
#J
 ATOM O 1 X = 0.3427 .89004 .09181
#
#DCREATE Z ATOM-SPECIFICATION  ...#
 This directive applies the symmetry operators given or assumed by default
 in the atom specification, and creates a set of new atoms from those given.
 The new atoms are added at the end of the current list. The serial numbers
 of the new atoms are given by:
#J
      NEWSERIAL = Z + OLDSERIAL
#
 The sequence Z ATOM-SPECIFICATIONS can be repeated.
 When moving from a centrosymmetric to a non-centrosymmetric space group,
 for example, atoms formerly related by the centre of symmetry can be
 generated :
#J
      CREATE 30 MO(1,-1) UNTIL C(15)

      Creates atoms MO(31) until C(45)
#
#DSPLIT Z ATOM-SPECIFICATION ...#
 Two new isotropic atoms are added to the end of the atom list for every
 atom referenced in the atom-specification. These atoms lie on
 of the principal axis of the original atoms anisotropic adp ellipsoid 
 and U[iso] set to U[meadian] of the original adp.
#PThe original atoms are not deleted.
 The sequence Z ATOM-SPECIFICATIONS can be repeated.
 The new serial numbers are given by
#J
      NEWSERIAL(1) = Z* OLDSERIAL and
      NEWSERIAL(2) = Z* OLDSERIAL +1
#
#DCENTROID Z ATOM-SPECIFICATION ...#
 A new atom is created at the centroid of the specified atoms, and with
 a pseudo adp representing the inertial tensor (ie the 'shape' of the
 group). The atom TYPE is QC, and its serial Z.
 The sequence Z ATOM-SPECIFICATIONS can be repeated.
#
#DKEEP  Z ATOM-SPECIFICATIONS ...#
#POnly the atoms referenced in this directive will be kept in the list,
 all the others will be lost, even though they can be referenced
 right up until the final END.
 The sequence Z ATOM-SPECIFICATIONS can be repeated.
#
 Atoms that are  KEPT  are moved to the top of the list, and stored in the
 order in which they are specified on  the KEEP  directive. Only one KEEP
 directive may be given. Use CONTINUE if one line isn't long enough for the
 atom sequence.
#PThe atom specifications may contain symmetry operators, which are used
 to generate the coordinates of the atoms that are to be retained.
  'Z' Is an optional parameter which defines the serial number
 of the first atom in the specification immediately following it.
 For each atom thereafter in the current atom specification, the serial
 number is incremented by one to generate the output
 serial number.
 Atoms whose serial numbers are changed in this way must be referred to
 in subsequent directives by their new serial numbers.
 If 'Z' is not given, the atoms retain
 their old serial numbers.
#PIf an  UNTIL  sequence is used after a  KEEP  directive has
 been given, it should be used with care, since the order of the new
 parameter list is different from the input list.
#DAFTER  ATOM-SPECIFICATION  ...#
#PThis defines the atom in the list after which atoms
 that are  MOVEd  should be placed.
 (See  MOVE  below).
 If this directive is omitted, the default option places the first  MOVED
 atom at the head of the list, and successive atoms after it.
 Once one  AFTER  directive has been given, atoms are placed behind the
 given atom in the order in which they are presented on  MOVE  directives.
 If no atom specification is given on this directive, subsequent MOVEs will move
 the atoms  to the  head of the list.
#DMOVE Z ATOM-SPECIFICATION  ...#
#PThis directive moves atoms about in the list and places them
 in the position defined by the latest  AFTER  directive.
 (See the previous directive).
 This directive does not remove atoms from the list, but simply
 reorders the list.
 The sequence Z ATOM-SPECIFICATIONS can be repeated.
#PThe atom specifications may contain symmetry operators, which are used
 to generate the coordinates of the atoms that are to be moved.
  'Z'  is an optional parameter which defines the serial number
 of the first atom in the specification immediately following it.
 For each atom thereafter in the current atom specification, the serial
 number is incremented by one to generate the output
 serial number.
 Atoms whose serial numbers are changed in this way must be referred to
 in subsequent directives by their new serial numbers.
 If no  'Z' is given, the atoms retain
 their old serial numbers.
#PIf an  UNTIL  sequence is used after one or more  MOVE  directives have
 been given, it should be used with care, since the order of the new
 parameter list is different from the input list.
#DSELECT ATOM-PARAMETER  OPERATOR  VALUE, . .#
#PThis directive selects and retains atoms with parameters satisfying
 the specified conditions.
 Only atoms that satisfy ALL the selection criteria, whether these
 are in the same or different directives, will be kept.
 All other atoms will be deleted from the list.
#PThe operators allowed are :
#N   8#
#J
            EQ            equal
            NE            not equal
            GT            greater than
            GE            greater than or equal to
            LT            less than
            LE            less than or equal to
#
 Examples of the  SELECT  directive are :
#N   6#
#J
      SELECT SERIAL LT 50
      SELECT OCC GT 0.5, OCC LT 1.5
      SELECT C(1,X) LT 1., C(1,X) GT 0.
      SELECT TYPE NE Q
#
 This example will only retain atoms with serial numbers less than 50
 and occupancies between 0.5 and 1.5.
 The  'X'  parameter of atom c(1) must also lie between 0.0 and
 1.0 oterwise it will be rejected, and any atoms of type Q  will be deleted.
#DSORT TYPE1 TYPE2 ...#
#DSORT KEYWORD#
 This directive has two formats, and is used to sort the atoms stored in
 LIST 5 into a user-defined order.
 The default action sorts the atoms  on their types and serial numbers.
 The types are taken in the order found in LIST 5, and atoms of each
 type are grouped together. In each group the atoms are
 arranged by ascending serial number.
 The order of the types of atoms may also be determined
 by specifying them explicitly on the SORT directive,  or by a mixture of
 these methods.
#
#PIn the second format, a keyword corresponding to an atom parameter
 name (as defined in LIST 5, see
 section #RLIST05#) is given, and the whole list sorted on
 increasing value of the specified parameter. Note that sorting on TYPE
 will give results depending on the 'collating sequence' of the computer.
 Fortunately, this generally leads to alphabetic sorting.
#PSORT sorts the whole list 5, and cancels any existing KEEP
 directives.
#
#DDSORT TYPE1 TYPE2 ...#
#DDSORT KEYWORD#
 This directive is exactly analagous to SORT, above, except that it sorts
 into descending order.
#
#DRENAME ATOM1  ATOM2  (, ATOM1  ATOM2) ...#
 This directive requires pairs of atom specifications (optionally separated
 by a comma). The TYPE and SERIAL of 'atom1' are changed to those of 'atom2'.
 Atom1 must exist in LIST 5, atom2 must NOT exist in LIST 5. An atom can be
 renamed repeatedly. If atom1 contains symmetry operators, these are applied
 to the coordinates of the renamed atom. An atom cannot be renamed to itself
 in a single step.
#
#DTYPECHANGE KEYWORD OPERATOR VALUE NEW-ATOM-TYPE#
#PThis directive conditionally changes the TYPES of atoms. If an atomic
 parameter selected by the keyword (see sort above) satisfies the
 conditions defined by the 'operator' and 'value' (see SELECT above),
 then the TYPE of the atom is changed to 'new-atom-type'.
#N   4#
#J
      TYPECHANGE OCC GT 1.2 O
                              If Occ large, convert to oxygen
      TYPECHANGE U[ISO] LE 0.03 N
                              If Uiso small, convert to nitrogen
      TYPECHANGE TYPE EQ Q C
                              Convert peaks (type Q) to carbon

      RESET U[11] .05 C(27) UNTIL C(50)
#
#DCHANGE  ARG(1)  ARG(2)  ARG(3)  .#
 There are two possible formats for each 'ARG(i)' on this directive.
 the first is :
#J
 PARAMETER(i)  VALUE(i)
#
 If  ARG(i)  is of this form, the specified parameter or parameters
 are changed to the value  VALUE(i) .
 If  PARAMETER(i)  defines one or more atomic parameters, then the
 symmetry operators found or inserted by default
 are applied to the resulting set of atomic parameters.
 For overall parameters,
 no symmetry information can be provided.
 The  VALUE  associated with this argument must always be present.
#PThe second form of  ARG(i)  on this directive is :
#J
 ATOM-SPECIFICATION
#
 For this form of  ARG(i) , the symmetry operators given in the
 atom specification or assumed by default are applied, but no
 other atomic parameter is explicitly altered.
 There is no  VALUE  associated with  ARG(i)  in this format.
#PThe two different types of argument on this directive may be used
 interchangeably :
#N   5#
#J
      CHANGE  S(1,OCC) UNTIL O(1) .5
      CONT    C(1,-2,1) UNTIL C(12)
      CONT    C(13,X) .0179
#
#DADD  VALUE  PARAMETERS  ...#
#DSUBTRACT  VALUE  PARAMETERS  ...#
#DMULTIPLY  VALUE  PARAMETERS  ...#
#DDIVIDE  VALUE  PARAMETERS  ...#
 These directives causes the 'value' to be applied to the parameter.
 'PARAMETER(I)' may be an overall parameter, or a single atomic
 parameter of one  or more atoms, as defined above.
 Any symmetry operators given with this directive will be ignored.
 Note that the parameter SERIAL is numeric, and so can be arithmetically
 modified.
#DPERTURB VALUE PARAMETERS ...#
  This directive perturbs the specified parameters using a rnadom
 number generator. The VALUE is the requested rms perturbation, in the
 natural units of the parameters. The mean deviation applied should be
 approximately zero, and the rms deviation applied should be
 approximately that requested.
#DSHIFT  V1, V2, V3   ATOM-SPECIFICATION . .#
 This directive reads the three numbers of a shift vector, which must
 be in the same coodrinate system as the atomic parameters,
 and applies it to the parameters in the atom specification.
 This directive does not create new atoms, but simply modifies
 those already present.
 Any symmetry operators given are applied before the translation.
#
#DTRANSFORM  R11, R21, R31, . . . R33  ATOM SPECIFICATION . .#
 This directive reads the nine numbers of a transformation matrix, which must
 be separated by commas or spaces, and applies the matrix to the atoms given
 in the atom specification.
 This directive does not create new atoms, but simply modifies
 those already present.

#DDEORTHOGINAL  ATOM SPECIFICATION . .#
 This directive applies the matrix vector saved by a previous MOLAX SAVE
 directive to the atoms given  in the atom specification. THEIR ORIGINAL
 COORDIANATES x,y,z MUST be in the MOLAX coordinate (Angstrom) system
 This directive does not create new atoms, but simply modifies
 those already present. Symmetry operators are not permitted.
#DUEQUIV  ATOM SPECIFICATIONS  .  .#
 The specified atoms to be converted so that they
 have isotropic temperature factors,
 U(equiv), defined by the SET UEQUIV command.
 IT IS NOT simply related to the
 diagonal elements of U(aniso).
 If an atom is already isotropic, no action is taken.
 If this directive is given with no arguments, all the atoms in the current
 atomic parameter list are converted to isotropic temperature factors.
 Physically impossible values are not rejected.
 Symmetry operators are ignored.
#DANISO  ATOM SPECIFICATIONS  .  .#
 This directive causes all the specified atoms to be converted so that they
 have anisotropic temperature factors.
 If an atom is already anisotropic, no action is taken, and any symmetry
 operators given are ignored.
 If this directive is given with no arguments, all the atoms in the current
 atomic parameter list are converted to anisotropic temperature factors.
#PNote that   the anisotropic temperature factor produced by this operation
 is in fact still spherically symmetrical, and
 that the s.f.l.s.
 routines automatically ensure that when the temperature factor of an atom
 is to be  refined, it is in the correct form.

#DINSERT IDENTIFIER=NAME#
 This directive inserts the value of the named identifier into the
 parameter 'SPARE' in the atom list, replacing any previous value
 (except 'RESIDUE' which uses the 'RESIDUE' paramter in the atom list).
 SPARE is normally used to hold rho after Fourier maps.
#P Currently available values for NAME are
#N   7#
#
# ELECTRON - This inserts the atomic electron count calculated
from the form factor
# WEIGHT - This inserts the atomic weight from LIST 29 (see section #RLIST29#).
# RESIDUE - This inserts a residue number into the 'RESIDUE' slot
 of list 5 replacing any previous value, such that all connected atoms
have the same residue number and each molecule has a different residue number.
# NCONN - This inserts the number of atoms connected to an atom, using
 the list of bonds.
# RELAX - This inserts an ID, based upon the bonding topology and atomic
 types of the atoms. Atoms at topologically identical positions will be given
 the same ID. (e.g. the terminal F's in a CF3 group).
#DSPHERE NEWSERIAL ATOMLIST#
This creates a 'shell' shape from the specified atom list. The centre of
the shell is at the centre of gravity, the size is the mean distance of
the given atoms from the centre, and the occupancy is equal to  the sum of
the occupancies
of the atoms listed. U[iso] is the mean of the U[iso] or Ueqiv of the
listed atoms.
 The atom TYPE is QS, with the given serial number. The
original atoms are not deleted, though they should be or their occupancy
set to zero. The atom type, QS, should be changed to something
appropriate.
#
#DRING NEWSERIAL ATOMLIST#
This creates an 'annulus' shape from the specified atom list. The centre of
the ring is at the centre of gravity, the size is the mean distance of
the given atoms from the centre, and the occupancy is equal to the sum of
the occupancies
of the atoms listed. U[iso] is the mean of the U[iso] or Ueqiv of the
listed atoms.
The atom TYPE is QR, with the given serial number. The
original atoms are not deleted, though they should be or their occupancy
set to zero. The atom type, QS, should be changed to something
appropriate. The DECLINATION and AZIMUTH are computed from the
constituent atoms.
#
#DLINE NEWSERIAL ATOMLIST#
This creates an 'line' shape from the specified atom list. The centre of
the line is at the centre of gravity, the size is twice the mean distance of
the given atoms from the centre, and the occupancy is equal to the sum of
the occupancies
of the atoms listed. U[iso] is the mean of the U[iso] or Ueqiv of the
listed atoms.
The atom TYPE is QL, with the given serial number. The
original atoms are not deleted, though they should be or their occupancy
set to zero. The atom type, QS, should be changed to something
appropriate. The DECLINATION and AZIMUTH are computed from the
constituent atoms.
#
#DREFORMAT#
This directive converts an old (non-FLAG) version of LIST 5 (see
section #RLIST05#) to the new format (extra parameters, old U[iso] 
slot now used as a flag and u[11] used for u[iso]).
#
#DROTATE#
This directive rotates a group of atoms a certain number of degrees
around a specified vector. The rotation is carried out in orthogonal
space so preserves the geometry of the group.
#
There are three options available:
ROTATE D X Y Z VX VY VZ atom-specification  #
ROTATE D ATOM1 VX VY VZ atom-specification  #
ROTATE D ATOM1 ATOMS2   atom-specification  #

The first rotates the specified atoms, D degrees around the vector
VX,VY,VZ keeping point X,Y,Z fixed. (X,Y,Z and VX,VY,VZ are given in
crystal fractions).
#
The second notation uses ATOM1 instead of X,Y,Z to specify the fixed point.
#
The third notation uses ATOM1 to specify the fixed point and the vector
from ATOM1 to ATOM2 to rotate around.
#
The rotation is D degrees anti-clockwise, when the specified vector
is pointing towards you.
#
1) Rotate the hydrogens of a methyl group by sixty degrees.

#PThis routine offers a
 way of re-ordering the atoms in LIST 5 (atomic parameters) or LIST 10
 (Fourier peaks), so that
 related atoms or peaks
 form a sequential group in the list, and the coordinates put the atoms
 as close together as possible.
#PTHIS ROUTINE DOES NOT USE LIST 29 (atomic properties) to get bonding 
 distances, but uses a single overall distance.
#PIn this routine, a set of distances is calculated about
 each atom or peak in the list in turn.
 For each atom or peak in the list below the current pivot, the
 minimum contact distance is chosen, and if this is less than a user
 specified maximum, the atom or peak is moved up the list to
 a position directly below the pivot. ( The  MOVE  parameter).
 When more than one atom or peak is moved, their relative order is
 preserved as they are inserted behind the current pivot atom.
 As well as reordering the list, the necessary symmetry operators are
 applied to the positional and thermal parameters to bring the atom
 or peak into the same part of the unit cell as the current pivot
 atom. The result of this process is to bring related atoms together
 in the list, and to place all the atoms in the same part of the unit cell. 
 Setting the GROUP parameter to YES causes the PART to be incremented 
 between isolated parts of the structure.

#PThis routine calculates a fit between the
 coordinates of a group of atoms in LIST 5 (atomic parameters) and another 
 group.
 The calculated fitting matrix may be used to compare the geometry of two
 groups, or it may be applied to transform the new coordinates which will
 then replace the existing group in LIST 5 (D. J. Watkin, Act Cryst
 (1980). A36,975).
#PIn this section, the group of atoms in LIST 5 to whose coordinates the
 fit is made is referred to as the 'TARGET atoms', and the group to be fitted
 onto that group is referred to as the 'IDEAL atoms'.
#PThe source of the 'IDEAL atoms' can be the LIST 5,
 a pre-stored idealised geometry,  or values read in from the directives.
 Those directives that refer to LIST 5 use the usual CRYSTALS formats for
 atom specifications. Once a transformation has been found, this can be 
 used as the basis for naming one fragment based on the names of 
 another.

#IInput for REGULARISE#
#PThe input to REGULARISE must define the groups to be fitted together,
 the method used for fitting , and the use to be made of the results.
 The user must ensure that corresponding atoms
 are specified in the same positions of the 'TARGET' and 'IDEAL' group
 definitions, so the program knows which pairs of atoms are to be
 matched.
   It is not necessary to have co-ordinates of every atom
 in the TARGET fragment. The inclusion of atom specifications
 for which coordinates do not exist in the parameter list indicates
 that the procedure must generate coordinates for these atoms.
  This allows the user to give a type and serial to new atoms
 created by the procedure.
 Any 'atoms' without coordinates are not included in the fitting
 process.
#PThe maximum number of atom  IDENTIFIERS permitted on an TARGET or
 IDEAL directive is about 250. Note that an UNTIL sequence only 
 counts as two identifiers.
 The number of implied atoms permitted is very large.
#PThe 'IDEAL' group may be given in various ways.
 For calculations
 on a single structure,  it may be extracted from the stored data
 in the same way as the 'TARGET' group.  In this case however, all the atoms
 must previously exist.
 Alternatively, explicit co-ordinates may be  given in
 a system defined  by the user,   or a predefined group may be used.
 In any case all the positional parameters of
 the atoms in the  'IDEAL' group will be known before the
 calculation begins. Finally, various pre-defined geometrical groups are
 available.
#IOutput from REGULARISE#
#PThe output from REGULARISE  includes the fragment centroids, their
 sums and differences and the
 transformation fitting the IDEAL onto the TARGET.

#IMethod of calculation#

#PThe centroid of each fragment is moved to the origin.
  The atomic
 coordinates are converted to an orthogonal system and rotated  to an
 'inertial tensor' system (to help condition the L.S. matrix).
#PThe fitting calculation is either constrained to be a pure rotation-
 inversion, or is a free linear transformation (rotation-diltion).
 If requested, the pure rotation component of the calculated
 rotation-dilation matrix is extracted.

 The calculated  matrix is applied to the co-ordinated of the
 'IDEAL' group, which is then converted back to crystal fractions,
 for comparison with the TARGET.
#DWARNING#
#PThe  3 by 3  transformation  matrices  generated  at  various
 stages  may  well  be  singular,  especially if  no rotation  is
 defined about one of the axes.  To combat possible problems with
 matrix inversion, a Moore-Penrose type matrix inverter is used.
 Even so, the user should be aware that there may be no unique solution
 to his problem. For example, when a planar fragment is fitted to an
 almost planar fragment one fit may involve inversion of the non-planar
 fragment. Inversion can be prevented by using Method 3.
 Note also that if almost planar groups are being fitted, the dilation
 factor perpendicular to the plane may be very large, and thus have an
 undesirable effect if applied to atoms far from the plane.

 groups will be calculated but not applied.
#PKEEP           The specified groups will be compared and the

 kept, and atoms  whose parameters have been
 calculated will be stored at the end of the new LIST 5.
 NOTE. If KEEP is given as a keyword, it can be followed by an offset
 to be used for the new serial numbers
#PREPLACE        The specified groups will be compared and the

#PFor REPLACE and KEEP the 'IDEAL' coordinates define the geometry to

#
#DGROUP NUMBER#
#PThis directive specifies the number of atoms in the groups to be matched.
 It should be the first directive for each group of atoms. The appearance
 of a second or subsequent GROUP directive in the input
 initiates the calculation for the previous group.
#DTARGET Atom Specifications#
#PThis directive is used to specify the 'TARGET' group of atoms. The directive
 will carry a series of atom specifications which will define the positions
 of the 'TARGET' atoms and the names of any atoms to be created by the
 routine. Atoms which exist in LIST 5 and atoms to be created can appear in
 any order in the TARGET group , although the order should be such that
 corresponding pairs of atoms appear at the same relative positions in the
 'TARGET' and 'IDEAL' groups.
#DIDEAL Atom Specifications#
#PThis directive is used to specify a group of 'IDEAL' atoms to be taken
 from the stored LIST 5. Every atom on this directive must exist.
#DSYSTEM a b c alpha beta gamma#
#PThis directive is will change the co-ordinate system used to interpret any
 subsequent ATOM directives.
#PThe initial co-ordinate system has orthogonal axes of unit length and is
 equivalent to :-
#J
 SYSTEM  1.0  1.0  1.0  90.0  90.0  90.0
#
#PValues must be given for a', b', and c', the angles default to 90.0.
#DATOM    x    y    z#
 This directive allows the cordinates of a single atom to be specified,
 in fractional co-ordinates in the current co-ordintate system. It must be
 followed by three decimal numbers which will be the X, Y, and Z coordinates
 of the atom.
#DRENAME offset number#
 This directive can only be used after previous directives have been 
 used to match one group onto another (REGULARISE COMPARE),
 and enables the use of the MAP 
 and ONTO directives. The MAP list of atoms is transformed by the 
 existing transformation matrix (which may have been computed from only a 
 few specified atoms). Each atom is then compared with the ONTO list, 
 and the TYPE and SERIAL of the MAP atom used to generate a TYPE and 
 SERIAL for the closest ONTO atom. 
#KOFFSET#
      The serial numbers of the atoms in the group being re-named are 
  related to those of the master group by an increment of 'OFFSET'. The 
 default value is 100
#KNUMBER#
 If the number of atoms supplied on the following MAP and ONTO 
 directives does not match NUMBER, a warning is printed.
#DCAMERON#
 This matches atoms as in RENUMBER, but only creates CAMERON files
 with atoms transformed into the common coordinate system.
#DMAP  Atom Specifications#
 This specifies the atoms whose TYPE and SERIAL are to be propogated 
 into the ONTO atoms. The atoms can be in any order.
#DONTO  Atom Specifications#
 This specifies the atoms to be renamed. The atoms may be in any order 
 and have any TYPE, but there must be EXACTLY as many as on the MAP 
 directive. The atoms can have any TYPE, but must have unique SERIAL 
 numbers.

#DHEXAGON X#
 The 'IDEAL' group is a regular hexagon with
 a side of length 'X'. The default for x is 1.0.
#DPHENYL#
 The same as HEXAGON with a fixed side of 1.39.
#DCP-RING X#
 The 'IDEAL' group is a regular pentagon with
 a side of length 'X'. The default for x is 1.4.
#DSQUARE X Y#
 The 'IDEAL' group is a rectangle with atoms
 at (x,0,0) , (0,y,0) , (-x,0,0) , (0,-y,0) . The parameters
 X and Y specify the size of the group to be used.
#DOCTAHEDRON X Y Z#
 The 'IDEAL' group is an octahedron with
 atoms at (0,0,0) , (-x,0,0) , (0,y,0) , (x,0,0) , (0,-y,0) ,
 (0,0,z) , (0,0,-z).
 The parameters X, Y and Z specify the size of the octahedron.
 'z' defaults to 'y' defaults to 'x'
 defaults to '1.0'
#DSQP X Y Z#
 The 'IDEAL' group is a square pyramid with
 atoms at (0,0,0) , (x,0,0) , (0,y,0) , (-x,0,0) , (0,-y,0) ,
 (0,0,z).
 The parameters X, Y and Z specify the size of the octahedron.
 'z' defaults to 'y' defaults to 'x'
 defaults to '1.0'
#DTBP X Z#
 The 'IDEAL' group is a trigonal bipyramid with
 atoms at (0,0,0) , (x,0,0) , (-x/2,0.86603x,0), (-x/2,-0.86603x,0) ,
 (0,0,z) , (0,0,-z) . The parameters X and Z specify the scale in the
 xy plane  and z directions.
#DTETRAHEDRON X#
 The 'IDEAL' group is a regular tetrahedron with
 an atom at the centre.
 'x' is the distance in Angstrom from the
 centre to an apex and defaults to '1.0'

#D3 - Checking for an additional symmetry element#
#PDetermine whether the two molecules in an asymmetric unit are
 related  by a  symmetry operation not  expected for the space  group.
 The matrix relating the molecules and the translation required  to
 make their centroids  coincide should display any additional
 (approximate)  symmetry  present. Remember that if one molecule is
 the enantiomer of the other, Method 3 will lead to an unsatisfactory
 fitting unless  one molecule is inverted, (by using the operator -1 in
 the atom specifications e.g. FIRST(-1) UNTIL C(23). This can be done
 even if the space group is non-centrosymmetric ).

#D4 - Renaming a group of atoms#
 A second group of atoms is given new TYPES and SERIAL numbers 
 so that the atom names are related to  a previously named group.
#P
 In the example, the user has identified two sets of four non-coplanar 
 atoms in each 
 group e.g. C(1) with Q(103), C(3) with  Q(99) etc. The transformation 
 is then used to map the whole of the first group (C(1) until O(25)) onto 
 the second group (Q(96) until Q(120)). Both of these groups must contain 
 the same number of atoms, but they may be in any order. Atom Q(103) will 
 be renamed to C(101), atom Q(100) to C(107) etc. Once all the atoms 
 have been renamed, the list could be sorted based on the serial numbers.

#
#D5 - Viewing matched molecules in CAMERON#
 This does the mapping as RENAME, but doesn't
 rename the atoms, just outputs CAMERON input files showing the two molecules
 superimposed. Use as follows:
#N   7#
#J
   \REGULARISE
   group 16
   target C(10) until C(26)
   ideal  C(60) until C(76)
   cameron
   map    C(51) until C(99)
   onto   C(1) until C(49)
   end
# This produces a cameron.ini, regular.l5i and regular.oby which may be viewed
 by choosing Graphics->Special->Cameron (use existing...) from the menu.
 Then type "obey regular.oby" in Cameron to colour the molecules nicely.
 The TARGET and IDEAL are used to obtain the mapping. The atoms in MAP and ONTO
 are just the ones you want to be included.
 Don't read the atoms back into CRYSTALS when closing CAMERON - they're in
 orthogonal coordinates.
#
#D - Comparing two structures#
 The SYSTEM and ATOM directives enable one to compare one structure with
atoms from a second structure. However, since the second structure is 
not part of the main model, CRYSTALS knows nothing about the 
connectivity.  Using the KEEP z directive, the second strcuture can be 
added to the DSC file, enabling a complete calculation to be performed.
# In the following example, O(16) is in a quite distinctly different 
position in the two structures, so place holder Q(16) is used during the 
first mapping. The input coordinates are added to the DSC file with 
SERIAL numbers off-set by 400.
#
In the second calculation O(16) of the original structure is compared 
with Q(416) of the input structure.

#PThis routine calculates a list of unique bonds between
atoms in LIST 5 including bonds to symmetry related atoms.
The bonds are stored in LIST 41.

#I Method of calculation#

#PThe BONDCALC routine uses the atomic positions from LIST 5 (the
model parameters, see #RLIST05#) (together
with cell (LIST 1, see #RLIST01#) and spacegroup information 
(LIST 2, see #RLIST02#),
the covalent radii from LIST 29 (atomic properties, see #RLIST29#), and any 
additional bonding information in LIST 40 to calculate a list of bonds. 
The algorithm and tolerances used depend upon settings in LIST 40.

#DDEFAULTS TOLTYPE= TOLERANCE= MAXBONDS= NOSYMMETRY= SIGCHANGE=#
#P This directive may only appear once. It affects the algorithm used
to update LIST 41.
#KTOLTYPE=#
 A value of 1 (default) causes \BONDCALC to use as a threshold for
 bonding, the sum of the covalent radii * the tolerance given.
 A value of 0 causes \BONDCALC to use the sum of the covalent radii + the
 tolerance given (in Angstroms), as a threshold.
#KTOLERANCE=#
 The tolerance to be used in the \BONDCALC calculation as a threshold
 for bonds. Exact use depends on the value of the TOLTYPE keyword above.
#KMAXBONDS=#
 Specifies the maximum number of bonds that may be formed to an atom. The
 BONDCALC calculation proceeds through the list of atoms searching for bonds,
 according to the TOLERANCE criteria. If more than MAXBONDS bonds are found,
 the best MAXBONDS will be kept. Best bonds are those where the sum of the
 covalent radii is closest to the actual bond length. (Where a PAIR 
 directive has been used, the best are the closest to the mean of the min and 
 max values  on the PAIR directive.)
 Note well: The calculation proceeds through the list of atoms, so bonds
 are formed from atoms near the top of the list to those lower down. While
 atoms lower down will still only form at most MAXBONDS bonds, they are 
 less likely to be the 'best' bonds since they are formed from atoms higher
 up the list. E.g. You have an H right at the end of the list, and you
 set MAXBONDS=1 for H (see ELEMENT). If the first atom forms a bond to that
 H, then no more bonds can be formed to that H even if they are better.
 If the H were at the top of the list it would get the choice of which bonds
 to pick. This is fairly unimportant stuff, it is rare that there will
 be ambiguities over whether something is bonded or not. The default value
 of MAXBONDS is therefore 15.
#KNOSYMMETRY=#
 0 (default) searches for all symmetry related bonds.
 1 ignores symmetry, will not find bonds across operators, may speed
   up bond bond calculation slightly.
#KSIGCHANGE=#
 Number of angstroms that any atom in LIST 5 must move during refinement
 for it to be considered a significant change resulting in a recalculation
 of bonding.

#KMAXBONDS=#

 The refinement directives specify which model
 parameters are to be refined, and the control directives control the
 terms in the minimisation function.
#PDuring structure factor least squares calculations,
 the partial derivatives with respect to each of the parameters is
 calculated for each structure factor and added into the 'normal
 equations'.
 This system of equations may be represented in matrix notation as :
#N  20#
#J
       A.x = b
       WHERE :
       A      'A' is a symmetric n*n matrix. an element
              'A(i,j)' of 'A'is given by :
               A(i,j) = Sum [ w(k)*Q(i,k)*Q(j,k) ] over k.
       n       number of parameters being refined.
       k       indicates reflection number 'k'.
       w(k)    weight of reflection k.
       Q(i,k)  the partial differential of Fc(k) with
               respect to parameter i.

               of which is given by :
               b(i) = Sum [ w(k)*DF(k)*Q(i,k) ] over k.
       DF(k)   delta for reflection k, given by :
               DF(k) = [Fo(k) - Fc(k)]

#
#PAs the matrix  A  is symmetric, only (n(n+1))/2 of its elements
 need to be calculated and stored, together with a few house keeping items.
#PIn some cases, because of either storage or time considerations,
 it is impractical to use the full normal matrix  A .
 In this situation, it is necessary to use a 'block diagonal approximation'
 to the full matrix, in which interactions between parameters which are known
 not to be highly correlated are ignored.
 The effect of ignoring such interactions is to leave blank areas of
 the full matrix, related symmetrically across the diagonal, which
 do not need to be stored or accumulated.
 A common (but not very efficient or stable)
 example of this approach is to place one atom in each of the blocks
 used to approximate the normal matrix, so that each block is of order
 either 4 (x, y, z and u[iso]) or 9 (x, y, z and the anisotropic
 thermal parameters).
#POne of the main purposes of the refinement directives is to
 describe the areas of the matrix  A  that are to be calculated.
 If the matrix  A  is approximated by  m  blocks of order
 n(1), n(2),.....n(m),
 The total amount of memory needed to hold the matrix
 and vector is:
#N   3#
#J
      Elements = 12 + 4*m + Sum n(i)*(5 +n(i))/2,

                                                 i = 1 to m

      Currently (June 2003) elements=8,388,608, giving over 4000
 parameters in a single block.
#
#PThe formation of the blocks that are to be used to
 approximate the normal matrix  A  is controlled in the refinement
 directive list by a series of  BLOCK  directives, each of which
 contains the coordinates that are to be included in the newly
 specified block.
 Further control instructions for the current block may appear on
 subsequent directives until a new  BLOCK  directive is found, when the formation
 of another block with its associated parameters is started.
#PTwo special directives are provided to allow for the most common
 cases required, full matrix refinement (a  FULL  directive)
 and one atom per block (a  DIAGONAL  directive).
 For all these cases only the parameters specified on the control directives
 and the following directives are refined.
#DCorrelations in Refinement#
#PHighly correleated parameters _B{MUST be refined together. Refining
 them in different cycles or different blocks will lead to an incorrect
 structure.
#PAs a rough guide, the following groups of parameters are in general
 highly correlated and should be refined in the same block if possible :
#N   8#
#J
 1.  Temperature factors, scale factors, the extinction
     parameter, the polarity parameter and the
     enantiopole parameter.
 2.  Coordinates of bonded atoms.
 3.  Non-orthogonal coordinates of the same atom.
 4.  U(11), U(22) and U(33) of the same atom.
#
#PIf it is necessary to split the temperature factors and scale
 factor into different blocks, their interactions must not be neglected
 but must be allowed for by using a 'dummy overall isotropic temperature
 factor'.
 In this case, the scale factor and the dummy temperature factor
 must be put into a block of order 2 by themselves, and the program
 will make the appropriate corrections to all the temperature factors.
 This dummy temperature factor should not be confused with the
 'overall temperature factor' which is a temperature factor that
 applies to all the atoms and is therefore just a convenience and requires
 no special treatment.
#PFor further details,  Computing Methods in
 Crystallography, edited by J. S. Rollett, page 50, and Crystalographic
 Computing, ed Ahmed, 1970,  page 174.

#PAlthough it is possible to input an overall temperature factor as one
 of the overall parameters, it is not possible to use it under all
 circumstances. The structure factor routines always take the
 temperature factor of an individual atom as the value or values stored
 for that atom. If the overall temperature factor is to be refined, the
 system will ensure that the current value of the overall temperature
 factor is inserted for the temperature factor of all the atoms. When the
 new parameters are computed after the solution of the normal equations,
 this substitution is again made, so that all the atoms have the same
 overall isotropic temperature factor. However, if the overall temperature
 factor is not refined, or no refinement is done, the individual temperature
 factor for each atom will be used, and the overall temperature factor ignored.
#DCAUTION#
#PIt should be noted that if a set of anisotropic atoms are input with no
  U[ISO]  key and  U[ISO]  data, then the default value of 0.05 will be
 inserted by the sfls routines. This implies that all such atoms are
 isotropic, so that the anisotropic temperature factors will be set to
 zero, and the calculation will proceed for isotropic atoms.
#
#DF or Fsq refinement?#
 Both type of refinement have been available in CRYSTALS since the early
 70's. For most data sets, there is little difference between the two
 correclty weighted refinements. One of the current reasons for choosing
 Fsq refinement is 'so that -ve observations may be used'. Such a choice
 is based on the misapprehension that the moduli in /Fo/ are the result
 of taking the square root of Fsq. In fact, it indicates that the phase
 cannot be observed experimentally. The experimental value of Fo takes
 the sign of Fsq and the positive square root. With proper weighting,
 both refinemets converge to the same minima
 (Rollett, J.S., McKinlay,T.G. and Haigh, N.P.,  1976, Crystallographic
 Computing Techniques, pp 413-415,  ed F.R.
 Ahmed,Munksgaard; and Prince,E. 1994, Mathematical Techniques in
 Crystalography and Materials Science, pp 124-125.Springer-Verlag).
 However, the path to the
 minima will be different, and there is some evidence that Fsq refinement
 has less false minima. Using all data, including -ve observations,
 increases the observation:variable ratio, but it is not evident that a
 large number of essentially unobserved data will improve the refinement.
 If the difference between F and Fsq refinement is significant, then the
 analysis requires care and attention.
#
#DHydrogen Atom Refinement#
#PSeveral strategies are available for refining hydrogen atoms.
 Which you use is probably a matter of taste.
#KGeometric re-placement#
 The command \HYDROGEN or \PERHYDRO is used to compute geometrically
 suitable positions for the H atoms. These are _B{not refined (either
 they are left out of LIST 12, or a fixed with the FIX directive). After
 a few cycles of refinement of the remaining parameters, they are deleted
 (\EDIT <cr> SELECT TYPE NE H) and new positions computed. This ensures
 optimal geometry, ensures that Fcalc is optimal, but avoids the cost of
 including the deviatives in the normal matrix.
#KRiding hydrogens#
 As above, the hydrogens are placed geomtrically, but they are included
 in the formation of the least squares matrix. Their derivatives are
 added to those of the corresponding carbon, and a composite shift
 computed for each carbon and its riding hydrogens. This preserves the
 C-H vector, but can distort C-C-H angles. A cycle of refinement takes
 almost twice as long as the re-placement method.
#KRestrained hydrogens#
 In this method, starting positions are hound for the hydrogen atoms
 (either from Fourier maps of geometrically), and the hydrogen positions
 are refined along with other atoms. The C-H distances and C-C-H angles
 are restrained to acceptable values in LIST 16. This calculation is even
 slower than the riding model, and would normally only be applied to an
 atom of special significance ( _i{e.g. a hydrogen bond H atom).
#KFree refinement#
 The hydrogen atom is treated like any other atom. Requires good data,
 and may be applied to atoms of special interest.
#
#PNote that the different methods can be mixed in any way, with some
 hydrogens placed geometrically, and others refined.
#
#DR-Factor and minimisation function definitions#
#DConventional R-value#
 This is defined as:
#N   2#
#J
      R = 100*Sum[//Fo/-/Fc//]/Sum[/Fo/]
#
 The summation is over all the reflections accepted by LIST 28. This
 definition is used for both conventional and F-squared refinement.
#DWeighted R-value#
 The Hamilton weighted  R-value  is defined as :
#N   6#
#J
      100*Sqrt(Sum[ w(i)*D'(i)*D'(i) ]/SUM[ w(i)*Fo'(i)*Fo'(i) ])

      D'  = Fo'-Fc'
      Fo' = Fo for normal refinement, Fsq for F-squared refinement.
      Fc' = Fc for normal refinement, Fc*Fc for F-squared refinement.
#
#KMinimisation function#
 This is defined by :
#N   3#
#J
      MINFUNC = Sum[ w(i)*D(i)*D(i) ]

      D', Fo', Fc' defined above.
#
#KResidual#
 The residual and weighted residual are defined by:
#N   4#
#J
      residual = Sum D'(i)**2
      weighted residual = Sum w(i)*D'(i)**2
#

#
#XSpecial positions#
#YSpecial positions#
#HSspec#
#PThe second major purpose of the refinement directives is to
 allow for atoms on special positions.
 For example, the atom at the Wyckoff site  H  in the space group
 P6(3)/mmc (no. 194) has coordinates  X,2X,Z .
 In a least squares refinement, the  X  and  Y  coordinates of this atom
 must be set to the same variable, i.e. they become equivalent.

 The command
 \SPECIAL (section #RSPECIAL#) can be used to generate the necessary 
 constraints or restraints,
 and may be invoked automatically before structure factor calculations
 by setting the appropriate parameters in  LIST 23 (structure factor
 control settings, see section #RLIST23#)

 The user can do this manually via  the refinement directives, LIST 12.
 The relationship is set up
 by an  EQUIVALENCE  directive, which sets all the parameters
 on the directive to the same least squares parameter.
 In this example, it is also necessary to alter the contribution
 of the  Y  coordinates to the normal matrix by multiplying the derivatives
 by 2.
 This facility is provided by the  WEIGHT  directive, which should not be confused
 with the weight ascribed to each reflection in
 the refinement.
 For a full treatment of atoms on special positions, see
 Crystallographic Computing, edited by F. R. Ahmed, page 187,
 or Computing Methods in Crystallography, page 51.
#PSimilar relationships also hold for the anisotropic temperature factors.
#PThe relationships between the variable  parameters in a refinement
 may also be defined by RESTRAINTS. These are held in LIST 17 (see #RLIST17#),
 and are particularly usefull if a complex matrix has been defined (e.g.
 using RIDE, LINK, EQUIVALENCE, WEIGHT, BLOCK, GROUP or COMBINE).

#XRefinement - atomic parameters#
#YAtomic parameter refinement#
#HSparams#
#PAtomic parameters may be specified in three different ways.
 Firstly, there is an  _B{IMPLICIT  definition, in which parameters for all the
 atoms are specified simply by giving the appropriate key or keys.
#P Hydrogen atoms are automatically excluded from implicit definitions.
#PSecondly, there is an  _B{EXPLICIT  definition, in which the parameters of one
 atom are specified by giving the atom name followed by the appropriate
 keys.
#P Lastly, the parameters for a continuous group of atoms in LIST 5 may be
 specified by an UNTIL sequence.
 This type of parameter definition is taken to be implicit.
#DKEY[1] . . . KEY[K]#
 parameters defined by the keys KEY[1] . . KEY[K]
 are included (or excluded) for all the atoms in LIST 5,
 e.g. X U[ISO]  implies that the 'X' and 'U[ISO]'
 parameters of all the atoms in the current LIST 5
 will be used. This is an _B{implicit definition,
 since parameters for
 all the atoms in LIST 5 are specified simply by
 giving the appropiate key.
#DTYPE(SERIAL,KEY[1], . . ,KEY[K])#
 parameters defined by the keys KEY[1] . . . KEY[K]
 are included (or excluded) for the atom of type 'TYPE' with
 the serial number 'SERIAL', e.g. C(21,X,U[ISO])
 implies that the 'X' and 'U[ISO]' parameters of
 atom C(21) will be used.
 This is an  _B{explicit definition.
#DTYPE1(SERIAL1,KEY[1], . ,KEY[K])  UNTIL  TYPE2(SERIAL2)#
 the parameters defined by the keys KEY[1] . . KEY[K]
 are included (or excluded) for atoms in LIST 5 starting at the
 atom with type 'TYPE1' and serial 'SERIAL1', and
 finishing with the atom of type 'TYPE2' and
 serial 'SERIAL2'.
 This definition is _B{implicit,
 since the number of atoms
 included by this definition depends on the number
 and order of the atoms in LIST 5.
#PParameter definitions of all three types may appear on any directive
 in any desired combination.

#PThe OVERALL scale factor is always applied to the structure factor
 calculation, though it need not necessarily be refined.
 LAYER and BATCH  scale factors are applied only if indicated in LIST 23
 (structure factor control settings, see section #RLIST23#),
 and ELEMENT scales only if the crystal is marked as being twinned in LIST
 13. Note that all of these scale factors can be expected to be correlated
 with each other, and the overall parameters.
#PThe layer scale factors, batch scale factors
  and the element scale factors may be
 given in three different ways, all of which are
 considered to be explicit :
#DLAYER(M), BATCH(M)   OR   ELEMENT(M)#
 this indicates only scale factor 'M' of the specified type.
 'M' must be in the correct range, which for 'N' layer scale factors
 is 0 to 'N-1', and for 'N' element scale factors is
 1 to N.
#DLAYER(P) UNTIL LAYER(Q)   OR   BATCH(P) .....#
 this indicates all the scale factors of the specified type from
 'P' to 'Q'.
 'P' and 'Q' must be in the correct range, as defined for 'M'
 in the previous section.
#DLAYER SCALES, BATCH SCALES   OR   ELEMENT SCALES#

#PThis LIST controls the structure factor calculation. The
 default calculation involves the minimum of computation (atomic
 parameters and overall sale factor).  More extensive calculations have
 to be indicated by entries in this list. The presence of a parameter in
 the parameter list (LIST 5) does not automatically mean that it will be
 included in the structure factor calculation.
#PThis list also controls the treatment of atoms on special positions,
 the use of F or Fsq, and the use of restraints.
#PThe presence of information in the DSC file does
 not ensure that it will be used by the structure factor
 routines. Thus, the operations corresponding to
  RESTRAIN ,  ANOMALOUS ,  EXTINCTION ,  PARTIAL ,  BATCHSCALES,

#KANOMALOUS=#
#J
      NO   -  Default value
      YES
#
 If  ANOMALOUS  is  YES , the imaginary part of the anomalous dispersion
 correction, input in LIST 3 (see section #RLIST03#, will be included in 
 the s.f.l.s. calculations.
 For computational efficiency, it is recommended only to use the value YES
 towards the end of a refinement. Note that the value YES should be used
 even for centro-symmetric crystals if they contain a heavy atom.
#KEXTINCTION=#
#N   3#
#J
      NO   -  Default value
      YES

 If  EXTINCTION  is  YES , the calculated structure factors are modified
 to allow for the effects of extinction by the method of A. C. Larson.
 See Atomic and Structural Parameters for the definition.
#
#KLAYERSCALES=#
#KBATCHSCALES=#
 SCALE keys have two alternatives:
#N   3#
#J
      NO   -  Default value
      YES
#
 If either SCALE key is  YES , the corresponding scale factors stored in
 LIST 5 (the model parameters) are
 applied to the reflection data. If this parameter is omitted, the
 scale factors are not applied, even if they exist in LIST 5
#KPARTIAL=#
#N   3#
#J
      NO   -  Default value
      YES
#
 If  PARTIAL  is  YES , the fixed partial contributions stored in LIST 6 
 (section #RLIST06#) are
 added in during the calculation of Fc and the phase.
 The partial contributions must already be present in LIST 6, and should
 have the keys  A-PART  and  B-PART . The atoms which have contributed to
 the partial terms should be omitted from LIST 5 whenever  PARTIAL  is
  YES .
#KUPDATE=#
#N   3#
#J
      NO   -  Default value

#
 If  UPDATE  is  YES , the contributions of the atoms to  A  and  B  are
 output to LIST 6 with the keys  A-PART  and  B-PART . If  UPDATE  is
  NO , its default value, the partial contributions are not changed
 during structure factor calculations.
 This requires that LIST 6 contain the keys A-PART and B-PART.
#KENANTIO=#
#J
      NO   -  Default value
      YES
#
 If ENANTIO is YES, then Fc is computed with
#J
      Fc = SQRT( (1-x)*F(h)**2 + x*F(-h)**2 )
#
 Where x is the enantiopole parameter from LIST 5. Once the correct
 enantiomer has been established, set this parameter back to NO.
#DMINIMISE= NSINGULARITY= F-SQUARED= REFLECTIONS= RESTRAIN= #
#PThis directive controls modifications made to the minimisation
 function during s.f.l.s.
#KNSINGULARITY=#
 The default value is zero.
 If this parameter is omitted, any singularities  discovered during the
 inversion of the normal matrix will cause the program to
 terminate after the current cycle of refinement.
 If  NSINGULARITY  is greater than zero, it represents the number of
 singularities allowed before the program will terminate.
#KF-SQUARED=#
#J
      NO   -  Default value
      YES
#
 If F-SQUARED is NO, the traditional minimisation function is:
#J
      Minimisation function = Sum[ w*(Fo - Fc)**2 ]
#
 If  F-SQUARED  is  YES , the minimisation function is:
#J
      Minimisation function = Sum[ w*(Fo**2 - Fc**2)**2 ]
#
 If  F-SQUARED  is  YES , the weights given by  w  in the above expression
 are assumed to be on the correct scale and to refer to Fsq
 rather than Fo's. Note that refinement can be against Fo or Fsq independent of
 whether the input was Fo or Fsq.
#KREFLECTIONS=#
 REFLECTIONS has two alternatives:
#J
      NO
      YES  -  Default value
#
 If REFLECTIONS is YES, the reflections stored in LIST 6 (and subject to the
 checks in LIST 28) are used for computing structure factors and the
 derivatives added into the matrix if required.
#PIf REFLECTIONS is NO,  LIST 6 is not used, whether it is
 present or not. This setting could be used for refinement against restraints
 only. See the section DLS, 'Distance Least Squares'.
#KRESTRAIN=#
 RESTRAIN has two alternatives:
#J
      NO
      YES  -  Default value
#
 If  RESTRAIN  is  YES, the restraints in LIST 16 (section #RLIST16#) 
 and LIST 17 (section #RLIST17#)
 are added into the normal equations.
#
#DREFINE  SPECIAL= UPDATE= TOLERANCE=#
 This directive controls the  refinement of atoms on special positions
 and the control of floating origins.
 The default action for atoms is to try to constrain them.
 However, if an atom is already the subject of a user defined constraint,
 the symmetry requirements are imposed by restraints. The site occupancy,
 positional and thermal parameters can be set to satisfy the
 site symmetry. The site occupancy is indepentant of any chemical or
 physical partial occupancy by an atom.

 restraining the center of gravity of the structure along the axis to remain
 fixed.

#KTOLERANCE=#
 Atoms within 'TOLERANCE' Angstrom of a symmetry equivalent atom are
 regarded as being on a special position. The default is 0.6A. For high
 symmetry spacegroups with disorder, the value might need reducing if
 multiplicities are incorrectly calculated.
#
#DALLCYCLES MIN-R= MAX-R= *-WR= *-SUMSQ= *-MINFUNC= U[MIN]=#
 This directive controls conditions that must be satisfied after
 each cycle if refinement is to continue. It can be used to detect
 converged or 'blown-up' refinements.
 The heading has been abbreviated, the  *  representing  MIN  and  MAX .
#KMIN-R=, MAX-R=#
 The normal  R-value  must lie between  MIN-R  and  MAX-R, otherwise
 refinement is terminated after
 the current cycle.
 The default values for
  MIN-R  and  MAX-R  are 0.0 and 100.0 percent.
#KMIN-WR MAX-WR#
 The Hamilton weighted  R-VALUE  must lie between  MIN-WR  and
  MAX-WR, otherwise the refinement is
 terminated after the current cycle.
 The default values for  MIN-WR  and  MAX-WR  are 0.0 and 100.0
 percent respectively.
#KMIN-SUMSQ=, MAX-SHUMSQ=#
 The rms (shift/e.s.d.) fo all parameters in the refinement must
 lie between  MIN-SUMSQ  and  MAX-SUMSQ, otherwise
 the refinement is terminated after the current cycle.
 The sum of the squares of the ratios is defined as :
#J
      SUMSQ = SQRT(SIGMA(SHIFT/ESD))/N)
  The default values
 of  MIN-SUMSQ  and  MAX-SUMSQ  are 0.03 and 10000.0, .
#KMIN-MINFUNC= MAX-MINFUNC=#
 The minimisation function, on the scale of Fo, must lie between
  MIN-MINFUNC  and  MAX-MINFUNC, otherwise
 the refinement is terminated after the current cycle.
 The default values of  MIN-MINFUNC  and  MAX-MINFUNC  are 0.0 and
 1000000000000000.0.
#KU[MIN]=#
 If Uiso or a principal component of the adp of any atom is
 less than   U[MIN] , then a warning is issued and the idp
 reset to u[min], or the components of the adp reset to MAX(Uii,U[MIN])
 or MAX(Uij,0.01U[min]).
 If this parameter
 is omitted, a default value of 0.0 is assumed.
#DINTERCYCLE MIN-DR= MAX-DR= *-DWR= *-DSHIFT/ESD= *-DMINFUNC=#
#PThis directive refers to conditions that must be obeyed before the
 next cycle of least squares refinement can proceed. (A quantity
 undergoes a positive change if  OLD - NEW  is positive, not
  NEW - OLD ). The definitions are similar to ALLCYCLES.
 The abbreviation  '*'  represents  MIN  and  MAX .
#KMIN-DR= MAX-DR=#
 Between two cycles of least squares, the change in
  R-VALUE  must lie between  MIN-DR  and  MAX-DR, otherwise
 the refinement is terminated.
 The default values are -5.0 and 100.0.
#KMIN-DWR MAX-DWR#
 The default values are -5.0 and 100.0.
#KMIN-DSUMSQ MAX-DSUMSQ#
 The default values are -10. and 10000.0.

#P\SPECIAL can be issued at any time to get information about atoms on
 special positions. However, normally it is called automatically by
 setting the SPECIAL keyword in LIST 23 (section #RLIST23#).
#PAtoms on special positions may be constrained through LIST 12
(section #RLIST12#), or restrained through LIST 17 (section #RLIST17#).
 CRYSTALS  will attempt to generate the special position conditions when
 requested via the
 SPECIAL command, and also  update coordinates of atoms on
 special positions.
#PIf the RESTRAIN option is chosen, then the special conditions are imposed
 on the refinement by restraints, which are generated without reference to
 what is being specified in LIST 12, the refined parameter definition list.
#PIf the CONSTRAIN option is chosen, then CRYSTALS examines the site
 restrictions as it processes LIST 12. If an atom on a special position is
 being refined without any user defined conditions (EQUIVALENCE, RIDE, LINK,
 COMBINE, GROUP, WEIGHT), and the related coordinates are in the same matrix
 block, then the internal representation of LIST 12 (LIST 22)
 is dynamically modified to include the necessary
 constraints. If the atom is already the
 object of a constraint,
 then LIST 12 cannot safely be modified, and the special condition
 is applied as a restraint. In either case, CRYSTALS warns the user about
 what is being done.
#PThe origins of polar space groups are always fixed by restraints, since this
 produces a better conditioned matrix than one from just fixing atomic
 coordinates.
#PThe UPDATE directive controls whether parameters of atoms near special
 positions will be modified to make them exact. The routine will update
 just the site occupancies, or the occupancies and the other variable
 parameters. The crystallographic site occupancy is held temporarily in the
 key SPARE, leaving the key OCC available for a refinable chemical
 occupancy. Take care if an atom refines onto (or off) a special position.

#DBLOCK  PARAMETERS#
 This directive defines the start of a new matrix
 block.
 Any parameters that come on this directive and any directives until another BLOCK
 directive are put into the same matrix block. If only one BLOCK directive is
 given, then the refinement is 'full matrix'.
#DFIX  PARAMETERS#
 The specified parameters are not to be refined.
#DEQUIVALENCE  PARAMETERS#
 Sets the given parameters to a single least squares parameter (see the
 examples).
#DRIDE  ATOM_PARAMETER SPECIFICATIONS#
 This directive links corresponding parameters for all the atoms
 specified on the directive.
 The parameters specified for the first atom given on this directive
 are each assigned to individual least squares parameters, and
 parameters for subsequent atoms are EQUIVALENCED,
 in the order given, to the corresponding least squares parameter.
  Only explicit atom parameters can be used on this directive. Usually, the same
  parameter keys will be given in the same order for all atoms referenced,
 though this may not be true for high symmetry space groups.
#DLINK PARAMETER_LIST AND PARAMETER_LIST ( AND PARAMETER_LIST.)#
  Links the parameters defined after the AND with those specified in the
 first parameter list. A least squares parameter is assigned to each
 physical parameter in the first list. Physical parameters specified in the
 second (and subsequent if present) lists are then assigned IN THE ORDER
 GIVEN to these least squares parameters. There must be the same number
 of parameters in each parameter list. The parameter list may contain
 more than one atom, and is terminated by the 'AND' or the end of the
 directive.  Overall and implicit parameters may  be given.
#DCOMBINE PARAMETERS_1 AND PARAMETERS_2#
  Combines the parameters defined before the AND with those defined after.
 Physical parameters are taken pairwise in the order given
 from parameter list 1 and 2 and two least-squares parameters defined such
 that one is the sum and the other is the difference of the physical
 parameters.
#N   4#
#J
      x' = x1 + x2
      x" = x1 - x2
                        where x1 and x2 are physical parameters,
                          and x' and x" are least squares parameters.
#
 Such a re-parameterisation is useful for dealing with certain sorts of ill-
 conditioning, such as that due to pseudo-symmetry,
 of the normal matrix (see Edward Prince, Mathematical Techniques in
 Crystallography and Material Science, 1982, Springer-Verlag, page 113).
 NOTE that only one AND can be given.
#DGROUP  ATOM SPECIFICATIONS#
 The positional coordinates of the
 atoms given in the ATOM SPECIFICATIONS are refined as a rigid group.
 Parameter specifications MUST NOT be included. The first atom specified
 is taken as the pivot atom of the group. All atoms in the group may be
 the subject of restraints to atoms in other parts of the structure, or in
 other groups. Use LINK, RIDE or EQUIVALENCE to build a suitable model
 for the temperature factors.
#PBecause of the linearisation algorithm used, some distortion of the group
 will occur if there are large parameter shifts. Use REGULARISE to re-form it.
#DWEIGHT w1 PARAMETERS w2 PARAMETERS . .#
 Before the contributions of the specified parameters
 are included in the normal equations, they are
 multiplied by the number wI .  Similarly ,
 when the normal equations are solved, the shifts
 and e.s.d.'s are multiplied by the same wI.
 The default  value of wI is 1.0.
 The parameters are multiplied by the value of
 wI that precedes them (see the examples).
#YObsolete Refinement directives#
#HSobsolete#
#
 The following directives may be removed in some future release.
#DFULL  PARAMETERS#
 The parameters on the directive directive plus
 any other parameters defined on subsequent directives
 are to be included in a full matrix refinement.
 The scale factor is automatically included, while
 the dummy overall isotropic temperature factor
 is fixed. This is equivalent to:
#PBLOCK SCALE PARAMETERS
#
#DPLUS  PARAMETERS#
 The specified parameters are to be refined, and
 they will be placed in the current block of
 the normal matrix. This is equivalent to:
#PCONTINUE PARAMETERS after the BLOCK directive.
#
#DDIAGONAL  PARAMETERS#
 All the specified parameters in the LIST 12 are
 included in a block diagonal approximation to
 the full matrix, based on one block for each atom.
 Both the SCALE FACTOR and the DUMMY OVERALL ISOTROPIC
 TEMPERATURE FACTOR are automatically included.
#
#DSUMFIX PARAMETERS [ AND PARAMETERS ] [ AND PARAMETERS ]...#
 Constrains the sum of the specified parameters (or groups of parameters) to
 be constant.
 If no AND is given, then sum of the parameters specified is constrained, by
 making the total of the shifts add to zero. If AND is given then the total of
 the shifts for each group add to zero, and each group is equivalenced to a
 single least squares parameter.
 E.g. constrain sum of three occupancies to be constant.

#PThe restraints that can be applied under this system are of a type
 originally described by J. Waser, Acta Cryst. 1963, 16, 1091.
 A good summary of the present facilities and aims is provided
 by J.S. Rollett in Crystallographic Computing, p170.
#PIn this method of restraints, the user provides  a set of
 physical or chemical restraints that are to be applied to the
 proposed model.
 These restraints are usually based upon observations of similar
 compounds (for example, bond lengths or bond angles) or upon
 known physical laws (for example, the difference in mean square displacement
 of two atoms along the bond that joins them).
 These restraints are not
 rigidly applied to the model, but each restraint has
 associated with it an e.s.d., which is used to calculate a weight
 so that the restraint can then be added into the normal
 equations.
 (The e.s.d.'s are provided on an absolute scale, and rescaled by the
 program onto the same scale as the xray data).
 In this way, the importance of the restraints, which are
 treated as extra observations, can be varied with respect to the
 importance of the X-ray data.
 If the structure is required to adhere closely to the proposed
 model, the restraints are given high weights (i.e. small e.s.d.'s)
 otherwise they can be given smaller weights.
#PIf, at the end of a refinement, the restraints are not compatible with
 the Xray data, this is shown by a discrepancy
 between the requested value for the restraint, and that computed from
 the refine parameters.
  If this is found, the validity of the restraints that have been imposed
 should be carefully checked.
#PIn order that the restraint routines should be completely general,
 each atom that is part of a restraint can be modified by a set of
 symmetry operators before the restraint is applied.
 (This is vital for molecules that lie across a symmetry element,
 as all the atoms that constitute the molecule are not present
 in LIST 5).
#PIf a structure uses symmetry related atoms to form bonds, the
 command \DISTANCE with OUTPUT PUNCH=RESTRAIN can be used to set up a
 proforma restraints list, including symmetry codes.
 The distances and e.s.ds
 will have to be edited to the correct target values. Use appropriate values
 on the SELECT, INCLUDE and EXCLUDE directives for DISTANCE to
 tailor the generated list.
#PNote that restraints may be used without
 diffraction data, see the chapter 'Distance Least Squares' for examples.
#DNOTE#
 The restraint directives are read and
 stored on the disc.
 Before the structure factor least squares routines
 can use the information in LIST 16 (restraints), it is validated against LIST 5
 (the model parameters) and stored symbolically as a LIST 26 (see #RLIST26#).
 This is done automatically by the SFLS routines (section #RSFLS#), but
 the user can force the verification of LIST 16 by issuing the command
  \CHECK (see later).
#YParameter, atom, bond and angle specifications#
#HSparamspec#
#PComposite parameter specifications are not permitted ( _I{e.g. U's), atom
 specifications are as in Chapter 4.
#PTwo atoms that are bonded together are defined in the following
 way :
#J
      atom1 to atom2,
#
  'atom1'  and  'atom2'  are standard atom specifications as described
 in chapter 4, and are separated from any other text on the line by
 at least one space. If there is more than one bond specification on  a
 line, it may be separated from another by either a space or a comma.
 The 'TO'  is mandatory, and is terminated by
 one or more spaces.
#PThe definition of an angle is an extension of the definition
 of a bond:
#J
      atom1 to atom2 to atom3,
#
 The angle is defined as the angle subtended at  atom2  by  atom1
 and  atom3.
 The restraints routines apply all the required symmetry if specified in
 an atom definition, while still
 conserving the partial derivatives in their correct form.
#I\LIST 16#
 The restraints routines regard all
 continuation directives as part of the original
 directive, so that the column of a
 character on a continuation directive will
 have had '80*n' added to it, where 'n' is
 the number of directives between the current
 continuation directive and the start of
 the directive. The ',', '=' signs and separator 'MEAN' are mandatory
 if shown in  the definition.
#DDISTANCES  VALUE, E.S.D. = BOND1, BOND2, . . . . .#
 The bonds specified after the '=' sign are
 restrained to have a length of 'VALUE', with
 an e.s.d. of 'E.S.D.'.
#DA-DISTANCES  VALUE, E.S.D. = BOND1, BOND2, . . . . .#
 Asymmetric distance restraint. The second atom in the bond is 
 restrained to be the given distance from the first, which is unrestrained.
#P Note that the qualifiers MEAN and DIFFERENCE cannot be used in this 
 context.
#DDISTANCES VALUE, E.S.D. = MEAN BOND1, BOND2, . . . .#
 Initially the restraints routines calculate the
 'MEAN' value of all the bonds specified by
 the directive. Each of the bonds
 specified is then restrained to be
 equal to 'MEAN' + 'VALUE', with an e.s.d. of
 'E.S.D.'. The 'DELTA' used in the
 right hand sides of the normal equations is
 defined by :
#J
      DELTA = MEAN + VALUE - BOND CALCULATED.
#
#DDISTANCES VALUE, E.S.D. = DIFFERENCE BOND1, BOND2, . .#
 Each of the bonds in this directive is restrained 
 to be equal to 'VALUE'
 plus the length of each of the bonds that
 follow it.
 The computed value of 'DELTA' used in
 the right hand sides of the normal
 equations is thus given by :
#J
      DELTA = VALUE + BOND(N) - BOND(M)
#
 Where BOND(N) occurs after BOND(M) in
 the directive.
#PEach such restraint is added into the
 normal equations with an e.s.d. Of  E.S.D. .
 However, as each bond is restrained to each
 of the bonds that follow it,  (N*(N-1))/2
 separate restraints are generated.
 Many of these restraints involve the same
 bond lengths and are thus not independent.
 To be strictly accurate, a non-diagonal
 weight matrix should be used with this
 restraint but such a facility
 is not available.
#PThe letters  DIFFERENCE  are terminated
 by one or more spaces and may be abbreviated to
 DIFF.
#DNONBONDED  VALUE, POWERFACTOR =, BOND1, BOND2, . . . . .#
 This restraint is similar to the 'DISTANCE' restraint in that the pairs of
 atoms defining the bond are restrained to be at the 'VALUE' distance appart.
 However, the weight to be given to the restraint is computed from the
 difference between the observed and the requested contact distance using the
 expression:
#N   3#
#J
       weight = 10000*(requested/observed)**(powerfactor*12)
#
#PWhen the observed equals the requested distance,
 the weight corresponds to an e.s.d.
 of .01. If the requested is less than the observed, the weight is reduced
 slowly as a function of the discrepancy. If the requested is greater than the
 observed, the weight rises rapidly with discrepancy. The function is like the
 repulsive part of a 6-12 energy expression, having greatest effect on
 anomalously short contacts. Powerfactors of between 1 and 4 seem to be
 suitable.
#
#DANGLES VALUE, E.S.D. = ANGLE1, ANGLE2, . . . .#
 Each of the angles given in the directive 
 is restrained to a value of 'VALUE',
 with an e.s.d. of 'E.S.D.'. The angles must
 be in degrees.
#DANGLES VALUE, E.S.D. = MEAN ANGLE1, ANGLE2, . . . . .#
 This is the analagous to the MEAN distance restaint,
 except that the mean value is computed for
 the specified angles and each of the angles
 is then restrained to 'MEAN' + 'VALUE',
 with an e.s.d. of 'E.S.D.'.
 The 'DELTA' values and the syntax rules are all the
 same as for the equivalent distance restraint.
#DANGLES VALUE, E.S.D. = DIFFERENCE ANGLE1, ANGLE2, . .#
 This restraint is analogous to the
 DIFFERENCE restraint  for bond lengths.
 Each of the angles in the directive is
 restrained to be equal to 'VALUE' plus each of
 the angles after it in the input.
 Although each such restraint is applied with
 an e.s.d. of 'E.S.D.', the same reservations about
 the validity of the weighting scheme exist
 here as for the equivalent distance restraint.
#DVIBRATIONS VALUE, E.S.D. = BOND1, BOND2, . . . .#
 The difference in mean square displacement
 along the bond direction
 of the two atoms that form the bond is
 restrained to be 'VALUE', with an e.s.d. of
 'E.S.D.'. In general, 'VALUE' is assumed to be
 zero, while the e.s.d. reflects the maximum
 discrepancy  in m.s.d. that would be expected for
 the type of bond being considered.
 If either or both of the given atoms is
 isotropic, the program will convert the m.s.d.
 into the appropriate form and calculate the
 derivatives for the isotropic atom correctly.
#P  Note that the atoms defining a 'bond' need not actually be bonded, but
 merely serve to define a direction. For really bonded atoms, try an esd
 of  .002; for 1-3 atoms or diagonals of phenyl groups, try .005.
#DA-VIBRATIONS VALUE, E.S.D. = BOND1, BOND2, . . . .#
 Asymmetric vibration restraint. The second atom in the bond is 
 restrained to be similar to the first, which is unrestrained.
#DU(IJ)'S VALUE, E.S.D. =, BOND1, BOND2, . . . .#
 This is a similarity restraint, and may be used to ensure that the
  vibration parameters of adjacent atoms are similar, as must be the case
 even for flexible systems. The esd used must be softer than for a
 VIBRATION restraint, typically 0.01.
 In this restraint, the difference
 between corresponding u(ii) and u(ij) terms
 is restrained to be 'VALUE', with an
 e.s.d. of 'E.S.D.'.
 Each bond that is specified generates therefore
 six separate restraints, one for each of
 the anisotropic temperature parameters. If
 an atom with an isotropic temperature factor
 is included in this restraint, the specified bond
 and all six restraints are ignored.
#DA-U(IJ)'S VALUE, E.S.D. =, BOND1, BOND2, . . . .#

 Asymmetric Uij restraint. The second atom in the bond is 
 restrained to be similar to the first, which is unrestrained.
#DPLANAR E.S.D. FOR 'ATOM SPECIFICATIONS'#
 This directive instructs the system to compute the mean plane
 through the atoms given in the atom specifications,
 and then to restrain each of the atoms to lie in the plane.
 The 'E.S.D.' with which each atom is restrained to be on
 the plane is given in angstrom.
 This parameter is optional and has a default value of 0.01.
 'FOR' is optional.
 'ATOM SPECIFICATIONS' define the atoms that are on the plane.
 Each 'ATOM SPECIFICATIONS' may consist of one atom, together
 with symmetry data, or two atoms separated by 'UNTIL'.
 One or more specifications must be given.
#N   7#
#J
      Examples :
       PLANAR C(1,2) UNTIL C(6) C(9) C(10,2,2)
       PLANAR 0.05 C(1) C(2) UNTIL C(6)
       PLANAR 0.05 FOR C(1) C(2) UNTIL C(6)
       PLANAR FOR C(1,2) UNTIL C(6)
#
#DLIMIT E.S.D. FOR 'PARAMETER SPECIFICATIONS'#
 This restraint seta a target shift of zero for the specified
 parameters, with the specified esd, and thus tries to limit the shift
 in the parameters.
 Since it modifies the normal matrix, it does not have the same effect as
 partial shifts (SHIFT,MAXIMUM,and FORCE in SFLS [section #RSFLS#]). 
 In particular, the
 e.s.d. on the parameter will depend upon the E.S.D. given to this restraint.
 The default for E.S.D. is .001. Reducing this to about .00001 will have almost
 the same effect as FIX in LIST 12. Increasing it to 10.0  will cause the
 restraint to have almost no effect unless the parameter involved is almost
 singular with respect to some other parameter. Note that this is only a
 restraint, and if the medel and X-ray data are good, the specified parameters
 will still shift. This restraint is valuable during the development of
 a poor starting model.
#
#DORIGIN E.S.D. FOR 'PARAMETER SPECIFICATIONS'#
 This is used  for polar space groups,
 where the singularity up the polar axis may be removed by  holding
 the electron weighted sum of all the coordinates up that axis constant.
#N   3#
#J
      Example
       ORIGIN Y
#
#DSUM E.S.D. FOR 'PARAMETER SPECIFICATIONS'#
 This restraint holds the sum of the parameters on the directive constant
 during the refinement.
 A typical case is where several (more than 2, which are better
 treated with EQUIVALENCE, in LIST 12) atoms share a site.
 'E.S.D.' is the e.s.d. with which the sum of the parameters is
 held constant.
 This is an optional parameter and has a default value of 0.0001.
 'FOR' is optional.
 'PARAMETER SPECIFICATIONS' define the parameters that are to be
 summed. They may be given as :
#N   5#
#J
       overall parameters e.g. SCALE,
       all atomic parameters of one type e.g. X, Y, U[11],
       atomic parameters of one type for a group of atoms
             e.g. NA(1,OCC) UNTIL RB(6),
#
#N   6#
#J
      Examples :
       SUM 0.0001 NA(1,OCC) UNTIL RB(6)
       SUM LAYER SCALES
#
#DAVERAGE E.S.D. FOR 'PARAMETER SPECIFICATIONS'#
 For this directive, the system computes the mean of the given
 parameters,
 and then restrains each to have the mean value
 with an e.s.d. of 'E.S.D.'.
 The parameters are as for the 'SUM' directive above.
#
#
#DSAME BOND-ESD ANGLE-ESD FOR GROUP-1 AND GROUP-2 AND ...#
 The first group on the card is the 'target' - 
 all following groups are mapped onto it (in order specified) and the distances and
 angles restrained - using the connectivity of the first group.
#
 The first two arguments are the e.s.d for bond length restraints and the e.s.d
 for angle restraints. Groups are seperated by the word 'AND'.
 NOTE the absence of the usual '=' sign.
 I.E:
#J
 SAME 0.01, 0.1 FOR RESI(1) AND RESI(2)
 SAME  PART(1001) PART(1002)
#
   maps all atoms in the first argument onto all the atoms in 
   the second argument.
#PTAKE CARE
   Although this shorthand is appealing, the order of the atoms in LIST 
   5 must be identical in both arguments, although the atoms do not have 
   to be adjacent.
#J
 SAME 0.01 , 0.1 
 CONT C(17)  C(18)  H(183) H(182) H(181) AND
 CONT C(17)  C(18)  H(182) H(181) H(183)
   imposes 3-fold symmetry on a single methyl group.

 SAME 0.01 , 0.1 
 CONT C(17)  C(18)  H(183) H(182) H(181) AND
 CONT C(17)  C(19)  H(193) H(192) H(191) AND
 CONT C(8)   C(9)   H(93)  H(92)  H(91) AND
 CONT C(8)   C(10)  H(103) H(102) H(101) AND
 CONT C(14)  C(15)  H(153) H(152) H(151) AND
 CONT C(14)  C(16)  H(163) H(162) H(161)
   restrains six methyl groups to have the same geometry as each
   other. Combining the last two restraints would make all the
   methyls have 3 fold symmetry, and all be the same.
#
#P Errors are generated if
   1) the size of any of the groups on the SAME card is not the
      same as the first group.
   2) the element type in a group does not match the corresponding
      element type in the first group.
#
 Warnings are printed if there are zero bonds to any of the atoms
 in the first group.
#
 The comma separating the e.s.d arguments, and the 'FOR' separating the
 e.s.d.s from the atom specifications are optional.
 The second e.s.d is optional, the default is 0.1 degrees.
 The first e.s.d is optional unless you wish to specify the second, the
 default is 0.01 Angstroms.
#
 List 41 (bonds) is loaded by the restraint generating routine, if it

#


#DDELU ADP-ESD  FOR GROUP-1 (AND GROUP-2 AND ...)#

 I.E:
#J
 DELU 0.01  FOR RESI(1) AND RESI(2)
#
#P Errors are generated if
   1) the size of any of the groups on the DELU card is not the
      same as the first group.
   2) the element type in a group does not match the corresponding

#
 Warnings are printed if there are zero bonds to any of the atoms
 in the first group.
#
 The  'FOR' separating the

 The e.s.d is optional, the  default is 0.01 Angstroms.
#
 List 41 (bonds) is loaded by the restraint generating routine, if it
 does not exist an error will occur. (By default L41 is kept up to date
 with the current model.)
#


#DSIMU ADP-ESD  FOR GROUP-1 (AND GROUP-2 AND ...)#
   Restrains equivalent elements of the  adps of all pairs on bonded atoms 
   in each residue. The RESIDUES are NOT restrained to be similar. Unlike
   SAME, a single group can be given
#
 The first argument is the e.s.d for adp-restraint.
 I.E:
#J
 SIMU 0.04  FOR RESI(1) AND RESI(2)
#
#P Errors are generated if
   1) the size of any of the groups on the DELU card is not the
      same as the first group.
   2) the element type in a group does not match the corresponding
      element type in the first group.
#
 Warnings are printed if there are zero bonds to any of the atoms
 in the first group.
#
 The  'FOR' separating the
 e.s.d.s from the atom specifications is optional.
 The e.s.d is optional, the  default is 0.04 Angstroms.

 does not exist an error will occur. (By default L41 is kept up to date
 with the current model.)
#

#YGeneral restraints#
#HSgeneral#
#PThe 'general restraint' enables
 the user to write out a restraining equation explicitly.
 The system
 automatically calculates the value of the restraint and then
 evaluates the partial derivatives for each of the refinable  parameters
#PThes restraints look like  simple
 fortran statements involving operators and operands.
#DOPERATORS#
 The available operators are :
#N   9#
#J
      (
      )
      **            must be followed by an operand.
      *             must join two operands.
      /             must join two operands.
      +             must precede an operand.
      -             must precede an operand.
#
 An operand may be a simple variable or
 an expression enclosed in parentheses.
#PThe operators above assume their normal FORTRAN meanings,
 and the combination of operands and operators is the same as in
 standard FORTRAN, except that all calculations are done
 in floating point.
#DATOMIC COORDINATES#
 These are specified by a modified form of the
 atom definition given above. This is :
#J
       TYPE(SERIAL,S,L,TX,TY,TZ,KEY)
#
  KEY  Specifies the relevant coordinate of the
 atom. The  KEY  is regarded as an
 obligatory parameter, but for the remaining
 symmetry parameters, the drop
 out rules and default
 settings described under the atom definition may be
 applied, so that the simplest form of
 coordinate definition is  TYPE(SERIAL,KEY), similar to a LIST 12
 definition .
 The usual parameter keys are recognized.
#
#DOVERALL PARAMETERS#
 The usual overall paameter keys are recognized.
#DVARIABLES#
 These are unsubscripted variables specified by up to
 8 characters, of which the first must be a letter.
 Many commonly occurring crystallographic
 quantities are already prestored by the system,
 and the user has the ability to declare new
 constants with a 'DEFINE' directive, which
 is described below.
 When a user defines a new variable, he must not use a name that
 has already been declared by the system.
 The system variables are:
#DARRAY VARIABLES#
#PThe system has pre-stored various arrays and variables holding
 useful crystallographic information, and
 users may not define or declare  new arrays.
 The addressing is done in
 the normal Fortran manner, except that
 the element required must be specified by numeric
 arguments, and not variables.
 Thus A(3,1) is allowed, but A(I,J) is illegal.
#J

#
#PThe weighting of least squares refinement is still very controversial.
 The matter is discussed at some length by Schwartzenbach _I{et _I{al in
 Statistical Descriptors, and further insights may be gleaned from
 Numerical Recipies. Weighting the refinement can serve several purposes,
 and the weighting
 may need to be changed as the refinement proceeds. The weighting of Fo
 and Fsq refinements will be different. To a first approximation,
#J
      w(Fsq) = w(Fo)/2Fo
                              note the problem as Fo approaches 0.0
#
#PInitially the analyst
 must choose a scheme which will hasten the rate of convergence, and
 reduce the risk of the refinement falling
 into a false minimum.
 Towards the end of the refinement, once all the parameters have been
 approximately refined, a different scheme will be necessary to generate
 reliable parameter s.u.s (e.s.d.s)

#PMy advice (DJW,1996) is
 to use unit weights for Fo refinement (1./4Fsq for Fsq refinement) until
 the structure is fully parameterised, and then an empirical scheme for
 the final refinement. It seems that pure 'statistical' weights are
 rarely satisfactory. The crucial thing is to look at the analysis of
 variance (/ANALYSE). The weighted residual (see definition of Fo' etc above)
 w(Fo'-Fc')**2 should be invariant for any rational
 ranking of the data. If there are any trends, then either the model is
 wrong or the estimates of w are wrong. If the model is believed to be
 full parameterised and substantially correct, the trend in residual can
 be used to estimate the weights.
#YWeighting for refinement against Fo#
#HSforefwt#
#PThis set of weighting schemes should be selected when
 the minimisation function that is to be used during the least squares
 process is given by :
#J
       SUM( w*(Fo - Fc)**2 )
#
 Where the summation is over all the reflections.
#YWeighting for refinement against Fsq#
#HSfsqrefwt#
#PRefinement against Fo or Fsq is also controversial. The controversy is
 not really concerned with negative observations, since Fo can be given
 the sign of Io. The real problem is that the error distribution for Fo
 is not the same as that of Fsq, and is not simply related to it for very
 weak reflections. However, the argument is academic, since the error
 estimates for Fsq are not really known.
#PCRYSTALS provides two different alternatives for the case in which the
 minimisation function is given by :
#J
          SUM( w*(Fo**2 - Fc**2)**2 )
#
 In the first of these options, the weights are calculated normally for Fo,
 and then converted so that they apply to Fsq
 by the operation :
#J
          w' = w/(4*Fo*Fo)
#
 Where w' is the weight for Fsq and  w  is the weight for Fo.
 This option is selected by the parameter  TYPE  =  1/2Fo
 in the  SCHEME  directive above.
 For example, pseudo unit weights are selected by the input :
#N   4#
#J
      \LIST 4
      SCHEME 9 0 1/2Fo
      END
#
 This option may be used with any of the weighting schemes above.
#PThe second option also uses the weighting scheme types for Fo, except
 that Fsq is substituted for Fo in the equations.
 This option is selected by the parameter  TYPE  =  Fo**2
 in the  SCHEME  directive above. This choice would be suitable for the
 Chebychev weighting schemes.
#I\LIST 4#
#DSCHEME NUMBER= NPARAMETERS= TYPE= WEIGHT= MAXIMUM=#

#
 The value of  NORMAL  indicates that the weighting scheme type
 is for refinement against Fo.
 If  TYPE  is  1/2Fo  or  Fo**2  the weighting scheme type is for
 refinement against Fsq (see above).
#PIf TYPE equals CHOOSE, one of the three previous type is chosen depending
 on the scheme number and the refinement type set in LIST 23 (structure
factor control, see section #RLIST23#).
#KWEIGHT=#
 This parameter determines the weight assigned to reflections during the
 determination of Chebychev coefficients.
 For each reflection the weight with which it is added into the
 Chebychev normal equations is given by :
#J
      W = 1/[1+Fo**WEIGHT].
#
 Thus if WEIGHT is equal to zero, all the weights will be the same and equal
 to  0.5.
 The default value is 2.0
#KMAXIMUM=#
 This parameter is used to set the maximum weight that can be applied, and
 is usefull for the Dunitz-Seiler scheme (13), and the Chebyshev
 schemes (10 and 14).
#
#
#DPARAMETERS P=#
#PThe parameters that are to be used to compute the weight for a given
 reflection are specified with this directive.
#KP=#
 This directive contains  NPARAMETERS  values. If this parameter is omitted,
 default values of zero are assumed for  P.
#PThe parameters must always be provided on the scale of Fo, not
 on the scale of Fc.
 For example, the agreement analysis programs can work on the scale
 of Fc, so that constants derived from such output must be put
 on the scale of Fo by multiplying them by the scale factor in LIST 5 
 (the model parameters).

#YChebychev weighting schemes 10, 11#
#HSchebychev#
#
 A[i] are the coefficients of a Chebyshev series in t[i]'(x),
 where x = Fo/Fo(max).
 (There is an account of CHEBYSHEV series in Computing Methods
 in Crystallography, edited by J.S. Rollett, p40).
 For this weighting scheme, the coefficients a[i] are calculated
 by the program using a least squares procedure which
 minimizes sum[(Fo - Fc)**4] over all the reflections.
 The resulting coefficients are stored in a new LIST 4
 as weighting scheme type 11 (see below),
 and then used to calculate the weights
 for each of the reflections.
 It is recommended that several different values of
  NP  are used (e.g 3 to 5), so that series of various orders are tested
 to see which gives the best fit. If negative or very small reciprocal
 weights are computed (i.e. the computed curve fall close to or crosses
 the ordinate axis), the parameter MAXIMUM can be used to restrict the
 maximum weight. For data on 'ordinary' scales, this will require a value
 of about 100.
 (This is best seen by computing an agreement analysis
 once the new weights have been calculated).
 The parameters P(i) need not be given,  because they are to be computed.
 When the Chebyshev coefficients have been determined, p(1) is
 overwritten by the value determined for a[1]. (Carruthers and Watkin,
 Acta Cryst (1979) A35, 698).
 Scheme 10 generates the parameters needed for a scheme 11.
#YRobust-resistant weighting schemes 14, 15#
#HSrobust#
 This scheme should only be used towards the end of a refinement, when
 all of the expected variables have been introduced.
 It is usefull when there is suspicion of uncorrelated but significant
 errors in the data, and its effect is similar to scheme 10 in the absence
 of such errors.
 The expression for W' is as in Scheme 10 above, except that X is Fc/Fc(max).
 This weight is then modified by a function expressing confidence in
 Fo-Fc. If the observed delta is large compared with the delta estimated
 from the Chebychev fitting, the reflection is down weighted. It it is more
 than 6 times the estimate, the weight is set to zero and the reflection
 flagged as an 'OUTLIER'. This scheme is recommended in preference to Scheme
 10, which is kept for old times sake. See E. Prince, Mathematical Techniques
 in Crystallography, Springer-Verlag, for the background.
#
#YStatistical Weights, 16#
#HSstat#
 This scheme can in principle be introduced at any time, but the
 parameters P(i) are best optimised near the end of a refinement.
 Typical values for CAD4 data are: p(1)=.001, p(2)=3.0 and p(4)=1.

#YUnstable refinements#
#HSunstable#
#PIf a refinement 'blows up', i.e. diverges rapidly, the user should
 seek out the physical cause (wrong space group, pseudo symmetry,
 incorrect data processing, disorder, twinning etc). If the cause of the
 divergence is simply that the model is too inaccurate, the divergence
 can by controlled by limiting the shifts applied in the first few
 cycles. The modern way to do this is via 'shift limiting restraints'
 (Marquardt modifier) in LIST 16. An older method was to use partial
 shift factors. These are set up by directives to the \SFLS command 
 (section #RSFLS#).

 During the solution of the normal equations, the user may specify
 that more or less than the whole calculated shift should be
 applied.
 Alternatively, the program can be instructed to scale the shifts so that
 the maximum shift for any parameter group is limited to a given value.
 (The  SHIFT ,  MAXIMUM  and  FORCE  directives).
#
#YSorting of LIST 6 for structure factor calculations#
#HSsort6#
#PDuring a structure factor least squares calculation, the values
 for the real and imaginary parts of  A  and  B  and their derivatives
 are computed and stored.
 These values are then taken and formed into Fc and its derivatives,
 which are added into the normal matrix.
 Between reflections, the values for A and B and their derivatives are
 retained.
 If the next reflection in LIST 6 (section #RLIST06#) has a set of indices 
 which are equivalent
 to the
 last reflection, the same values for the real and imaginary parts of A and B
 and their derivatives can be used.
#PThis type of situation can arise either when anomalous scatterers
 are present, implying that F(h,k,l) is not equal to F(-h,-k,-l), or
 when an extinction parameter is being refined and formally equivalent
 reflections have different Fo values and mean path lengths.
 In this sort of case, the time for a structure factor calculation
 can be significantly reduced if reflections with symmetry related sets
 of indices are adjacent in LIST 6, when the conserved values
 of A and B can be used repeatedly.
#PIn a similar way,
 during a structure factor calculation for a twinned crystal, the
 contribution and derivatives for each element are stored as they are
 calculated and then combined to produce /FCT/ when all the contributions
 have been accumulated.
 Between reflections this stored information is retained, so that if the
 next reflection contains contributions from elements with the same
 indices as the previous reflection,
 it is unnecessary to re-compute  the A and B parts.
 Obviously,
 reflections with common contributors must again be adjacent in LIST 6,
 in which case a structure factor calculation, with or without least
 squares, takes only slightly longer than the corresponding normal calculation
 with the same number of observations.
#I\SFLS#
#PThe directives are carried out in the order in
 which they appear.
#PThe directives  REFINE,  SCALE,  and CALCULATE
 initiate cycles of S.F.L.S. calculations. If one of the
 directives  SHIFT ,  MAXIMUM  or  FORCE  is given following  REFINE,
 a scaled shift will be applied to that cycle of refinement.

#KLIST#
 Controls the listing of reflection information.
#N   3#
#J
      OFF   -  Default
      MEDIUM
      HIGH
#
 The value OFF  indicates that the
 discrepancy for each reflection (/Fo-Fc/)/Fo is computed and if greater than
 3*(overall R factor) from the previous cycle of structure factors, a warning
 is printed. Only the first 25 such reflections are listed.
#PIf the ENANTIOPOLE parameter is activated in LIST 23 (structure factor
  control, see section #RLIST23#), sensitive reflections,
 for which /(F+)-(F-)/ .> .05 *((F+)+(F-)/2), are also listed.
#PIf  LIST  is  MEDIUM , the structure factors are listed as they
 are computed. The output contains h, k, l, Fo
 (on the scale of Fc), Fc, the phase and sin(theta)/lambda,
 the unweighted and weighted delta's.
 (Fo - Fc or Fo**2 - Fc**2, depending upon the type of refinement
 being done), and information which is useful when anomalous
 dispersion effects are present, and contains the real part of Fc (/Fc'/),
 the imaginary part of Fc (/Fc"/), the computed difference between
 /F(h,k,l)/**2 and /F(-h,-k,-l)/**2, and the calculated or theoretical
 Bijvoet ratio (t.b.r.).
#XTwinning#
#PWhen a twinned crystal structure is being refined,  LIST  =  HIGH
 gives FoT and /FcT/ in place of Fo and Fc, respectively.
 Also, the contributions of each element to each reflection of a twinned
 crystal are listed. As well as /FcT/ and the indices,
 Fc, multiplied by the square root of the element scale factor, and the
 element number are also printed for each component under the column headed
 by /FC'/. This option is only obeyed if LIST 13 (section #RLIST13#)
 indicates that a twinned crystal structure is being refined.
#PList MEDIUM and HIGH produces one line of output for each reflection.
#KMAP#
 Controls printing of the memory map - mainly used by programmers
#N   3#
#J
      NONE  -  Default value
      PART
      FULL
#
 If  MAP  is  PART , a list of core addresses is printed,
 together with any unused locations. If  MAP  is  FULL , the addresses and
 contents of the areas of code claimed by each list as it is brought down
 are printed on the line printer as the list is loaded.
 This option produces reams of output and should never be used
 except by programmers.
 If  MAP  is  NONE , its default value, a core map is
 not printed.
#K/Fo/#
 Controls the treatment of twinned data.
#N   2#
#J
      FoT        -  Default value
      Scaled-FoT
#
 In the refinement of a twinned crystal, if  /Fo/  =  FoT , its
 default value, the FoT is output as the data for the key  /Fo/ , the
 corresponding /FcT/ is output for  Fc , and the phase is arbitrarily
 set to zero. If  /Fo/  is  SCALED-FoT , the data for  Fo ,  Fc
 and  PHASE  contain an estimate of the required quantities for the
 element in whose reference system the nominal indices are given, i.e.
 estimates of the resolved data are produced.
#KTHRESHOLD#
 Sets a sigma(I) threshold for computing the restricted Rfactor. The 
default value is 4.0
#DSCALE LIST= MAP= /Fo/=#

#KMATRIX#
 Controls re-use of the normal matrix
#N   2#
#J
      NEW  -  Default value
      OLD
#
 If MATRIX is NEW, a new matrix is computed for the current cycle.
#
#P If  MATRIX  is  OLD , the left hand side of the normal matrix is not
 accumulated during the cycle of refinement. Instead, the version that
 already exists is used with the new right hand sides. This option
 is particularly useful at the end of a refinement of a large structure
 when the left hand side does not change appreciably from cycle to cycle.
 It greatly reduces the time for a cycle.
#KMONITOR#
 Controls the shift information printed out.
#N   2#
#J
      LOW  -  Default value
      MEDIUM
#
 The MEDIUM listing outputs details about all parameters refined, and lists
 the values, shifts and e.s.d.s of all parameters in LIST 5. The LOW
 listing outputs information only for those l.s. parameters for which the
 SHIFT RATIO exceeds 3.0, and/or the SHIFT/ESD  exceeds 1.0 . Only those
 atoms in LIST 5 containing one or more refinable parameters are listed.
#KINVERTOR#

#N   2#
#J
      CHOLESKI  -  Default value
      EIGENVALUE
#
 The default Choleski invertor is suitable for most well conditioned problems.
 The alternative Eigenvalue invertor is suitable for ill-conditioned cases,
 such as those involving pseudo-symmetry. It is slower than the Choleski
 method and cannot handle such large normal matrices. The memory
 required is almost three times that used for each block in the Cholesky
 method.
#KAUGFACT#
 This is a constant to be added to all eigen values during eigenvalue
 inversion. The default value is 0.0.
#KFILTER#
 The inverse of eigen values below this threshold are set to 0.0 rather than
 1./value. It filters out latent singularities. The default is 0.00005
#KDISCRIMINATOR#
 If the ratio of two adjacent eigenvalues in a ranked listing exceeds this
 value, the inverse of the smaller and all subsequent eigen values is set
 to 0.0. The default is 100.0
#DSHIFT  KEY = VALUE  KEY = VALUE .  .  .  .#
#PThis directive sets the shift factor for the specified cycle of
 refinement. (The shift factor is the amount by which the calculated
 shift is multiplied before it is applied to generate the new parameters).
 For each of the parameters given by the  KEYS  on the directive,
 the shift factor is changed to the value given by  VALUE.
 The  =  sign is not optional. 
#
 If more
 than one shift directive ( SHIFT ,  MAXIMUM  or  FORCE ) is given for
 the same parameter, only the last is obeyed.
#
 The following  KEYS  are recognized :
#N   7#
#J
      GENERAL   This refers to all the variable parameters
      OVERALL   This refers to the overall parameters

      OCC     U[ISO]      X       Y       Z
      U[11]   U[22]   U[33]   U[23]   U[13]   U[12]
      SPISO   SPSIZE  LINISO  LINSIZE LINDEC  LINAZI
      RINGISO RINGSIZ RINGDEC RINGAZI 
#
 This is the default for GENERAL, OVERALL and 
 SPECIAL parameters, with default shift factors 1.0.
#DMAXIMUM  KEY = VALUE  KEY = VALUE .  .  .  .#
#PThis directive is similar to the directive  SHIFT  above, except that the
 maximum shift that is applied for the given parameters cannot be
 greater than  VALUE. The units of  VALUE  are conventional,
 WITH x, y, z measured in angstrom, and ADPs in Angstrom sq. If none of 
 the shifts exceend VALUE, then they are applied unmodified.
 This provides a
 method of automatically scaling down the applied shifts if the matrix 
 inversion has become unstable. Shift limiting restraints (LIST 16) are a 
 more controlled alternative
#
 The KEYS are the same as in SHIFT above, and this is the default 
 action for Occ, adps and positions, with maximal values:
#J
      OCC 1.0
      U*  0.05 (Angstrom sq)
      X's 1.0  (Angstom)

#
#DFORCE  KEY = VALUE  KEY = VALUE .  .  .  .#
#PThis is similar to MAXIMUM  above, except that the
 maximum shift is scaled to VALUE even if it is less than VALUE. 
#
#
 The KEYS are the same as in SHIFT above. There is no default
 shift.
#DVECTOR MONITOR MAP Fo PUNCH MATRIX#
#PThis is an obsolete feature, and will be removed at a later date.
#PThis directive indicates that structure factors are to be calculated
 and then the shift vector stored in LIST 24 (see #RLIST24#) is to be applied.
 This is used to apply a shift vector calculated from one of
 the eigenvalues of the normal matrix. Although no new matrix is produced
 by this directive, sufficient space must be allocated for the normal
 matrix, since it is loaded when the new coordinates are calculated.

#PANALYSE provides a comparison between Fo and Fc as a

 ranges of sin(theta)/lambda. For a well refined structure with suitable
 weights, <Fo>/<Fc> should be about unity for all ranges, and <wdeltasq>
 should also be about unity for all ranges. A serious imbalance in Fo/Fc
 may mean the structure is incomplete, or unsuitable data reduction 
 (section #RDATAREDUC#). A

 will be performed after the layer scaling so that the results of the

 In this way the effects of layer scaling can be seen without damaging

#PAlthough this is a least squares fitting technique for an arbitary
 model, it does not form part of the main refinement module. The DIFABS
 parameters cannot be refined simultaneously with the atomic parameters.
#PA low order term Fourier series is used to model an absorption surface for
 differences between the observed structure factors and those obtained from a
 structure factor calculation after isotropic least squares refinement.
 Spherical polar angles are used to define the incident and diffracted
 beam path
 directions so that each reflection is characterised by four angles - viz.
 PHI(p),
 MU(p), PHI(s), and MU(s).  A theta-dependent correction is evaluated to allow
 for diffracted beams with different path lengths occurring at the same polar
 angles.  A low order term Fourier series is used in Bragg angle THETA,
 but is highly correlated with the temperature factors, and not normally
 recommended.
  This version is general for any 4-circle diffractometer data collection
 geometry.
#PThe quantity minimised is the sum of the squares of the residuals, Rj, where
#
#J
               Rj = ( //Fc/-/Fo//)wj
#
#PThe weighting function, wj, used is derived from the overall scale factor,
 the counting statistics standard deviation, and the Lorentz-polarisation
 factor.
#PIn the original implementation, the correction factor was applied to
 Fo. This lead to criticism in the literature that the observations were
 being tampered with. In the current implementaion in CRYSTALS, the
 correction can be applied to Fo or Fc.

#
#PImplementation
#
#PThe correction is evaluated using observed structure factors, /Fo/, corrected
 for Lorentz-polarisation effects and any decay in intensity standards during
 data collection, with systematically absent reflections removed. Since
 equivalent reflections will be measured at different diffractometer
 settings, the  correction should be  calculated and  applied to the data set
 without any transformation of the reflection indices, and without
 symmetry- equivalent or Friedel-pair reflections being averaged.
 Calculated  amplitudes must be obtained from  the  isotropic
 refinement of an as-complete a model as practical from the unique (merged)
 data set. Such a LIST 6 (reflections, section #RLIST06#) will probably be 
 unsuitable for Fourier or
 difference maps (since these expect a unique segment of data only) unless
 you then remerge the data. The best maps must be computed
 with the correction applied to Fo before the data is merged.  In addition,
 the most reliable merging R factor (Rint) must be computed from
 corrected Fos.

#DWARNING #
 To use DIFABS most successfully, you should probably do data-reduction
 again from scratch, inhibiting the merging of all but exactly equivalent
 reflections.
#PIn favourable cases, when the observed data is the unique segment plus a
 small redundant volume (e.g. often the -1 layers at Oxford), you may get away
 with applying the correction to normally (merged) processed data during
 structure development.
#POnce the structure is fully developed (ie all atoms found
 and partially refined with an extinction correction if necessary), data
 reduction should be repeated inhibiting all index transformations.
 New values of Fc must be computed from
 isotropic atoms (Use UEQUIV in \EDIT to recover equivalent isotropic
 temperature factors, and then do a few cylces of isotropic refinement)
 and the DIFABS correction applied to Fc. Anisotropic refinement can be
 computed to completion (including optimisation of weights) using
 unmerged data. If you wish to see an  absorption correctd Rint
 and compute a final difference map, the data must be re-merged. Use
 DIFABS with MODE = TRANSFER to move the correction onto Fo before
 transforming indices, sorting and merging the data.

#DX-AXIS MINIMUM= STEP= MAXIMUM= DIVISION=#
#PThis directive specifies how the x-axis is to be divided.
#KMINIMUM=#
 This parameter gives the initial value along the x-direction.
 If it is omitted, a default value of 0.0 is assumed for  MINIMUM.
#KSTEP=#
 This parameter, which has a default value of 0.3, gives the
 step along the x-direction.
#KMAXIMUM=#
 This parameter, which has a default value of 1.0, gives the
 final value along the x-direction.
#KDIVISION=#
 If  DIVISION  is greater than zero, it defines the number of
 divisions into which the x-axis is to be divided.
 In this case, the three remaining parameters are expressed in
 terms of  DIVISION  and give the first point ( MIN ), the
 increment between successive points ( STEP ) and the final
 point to be calculated ( MAX ). If the divisions of the unit
 cell along the x-axis are given in this way, the user must
 ensure that sufficient map is calculated for the map scan, by
 adding one extra point beyond the asymmetric unit at both ends
 along the x-axis. If this is not done, peaks at the edge of the
 asymmetric unit may be missed by the peak search.
#PIf  DIVISION  is equal to zero, which is its default value,
 the Fourier  routines will calculate the number of divisions
 required along the x-axis. In this case,  STEP  is the interval
 between successive points along the axis in angstrom.
 If this parameter is less than 0.05, a default value of 0.3 angstrom
 is used.  MINIMUM  And  MAXIMUM  define the first and last points to be
 calculated and are given in fractional coordinates.
 When the values of  MIN  and  MAX  are converted into unit cell
 divisions, an extra point is added at each end to ensure that the
 peak search functions correctly.

 a form of weighted Fo map, with coefficients w*Fo if the reflection is
 in a centro-symmtric class, otherwise (2*w*Fo)-Fc, where w is the Simm weight.
 NOTE this is not the same as w(2*Fo-Fc), a Sim weighted 2Fo-Fc map. It has
 the property that known and unknown atom peak heights are approximately the

      AUTOMATIC  -  Default value
      YES
#
 If SCALE is YES,
 the program computes a scale factor rather than take one
 from LIST 14 (Fourier control - section #RLIST14#). The 
 scale factor is computed by summing the modulus of
 all the contributors to the map, and dividing this total into
 ORIGIN  (see the next parameter).
 For a Patterson, therefore, the origin is scaled to be  ORIGIN,
 while for other maps a scale factor is computed which guarantees
 that every number is less than  ORIGIN.
#PIf  SCALE  is  NO, the scale factor is taken from LIST 14
 for all types of Fourier maps.
 If SCALE is AUTOMATIC,
 there is automatic scaling for an external or Patterson map,
 while other maps take their scale factors from LIST 14.
#KORIGIN=#
 The default value for this parameter is 999, and is used when
 the program calculates a scale factor (see  SCALE  above).
#KNMAP#
 Controls negation of the density values, with default NO.
 Use YES, in which case the density values are negated,
 when looking for minima. This
 feature permits location of hydrogen in Neutron maps, and the location of
 minima (which become maxima) generally. Set the Peak Height positive
 even when searching for minina, since at the time of the search the
 minima are inverted. The out put density values have the correct sign.
 Use \COLLECT 10 5 rather than \PEAKS on negated maps, since PEAKS
 cannot handle minima.
#KMONITOR=#

#J
      LOW
      MEDIUM  -  Default value

#PIf  WEIGHT  is  NO , its default value, then the map is not weighted.
#PIf  WEIGHT  is set equal to  SIM , then SIM weights are computed.
 This option requires both LIST 29 (atomic properties, section #RLIST29#
 and LIST 5. The occupation factors in LIST 5 are used to determine how many
 atoms of each type are present, and LIST 29 indicates how many should be
 present. See the notes under 'TYPE', above.
#PIf  WEIGHT  is  LIST-6 , then the map is weighted with the weight
 stored in LIST 6 (section #RLIST06#).
#KREJECT=#

#J

      QUARTER
      HALF
#
 If REJECT  is NONE, all the reflections in LIST 6 which are
 allowed by LIST 28 are included.
 In this case, no check is made on the /Fc/ value.
 For an /Fo/, /Fc/ and difference Fourier, the program expects that there
 should be an /Fc/ value if the phase is to be defined.
 Accordingly, reflections where /Fc/ < 0.001 are normally rejected
 for such Fouriers, and this is the default option of  SMALL.
#PSome users like to omit reflections if Fc is smaller then a fraction of
 Fo. The options QUARTER and HALF are available.

 The default value for this parameter is zero, and specifies the value
 of F(000) to be used.
#KCALC#
#N   2#
#J
      NO   -  Default value
      YES
#
 Value YES causes structure factors (i.e. Fc and phase) to be calculated
 immediately before the map is computed. This option can only be activated
 if some previous task with the current DSC file
 has computed phases via a \SFLS command (section #RSFLS#) and left a 
 LIST 33 on the disk (List 33 is the stored representation of the SFLS
 command, so that the program can rememeber how the last refinement was

#KHEIGHT=#
 This parameter sets the search of the map for all
 peaks with an electron density greater than  HEIGHT. If this
 parameter is omitted, a default value of 50 is assumed
 for an external or Patterson map. For all other maps, the map is scanned
 for peaks greater than 1.5*SCALE, where  SCALE  is the map scale factor,
 either taken from LIST 14 (Fourier control - section #RLIST14#) 
or computed using  SCALE  =  YES  above.
#KNPEAK=#
 This parameter, whose default value is 0, determines the number
 of peaks to be retained after they have been ranked by peak height.
 If NPEAK is zero or negative, the number of peaks saved is computed from
#N   3#
#J
      NPEAK = (Cell volume) / (18 * Space Group multiplicity)

                               18 is an average atomic volume.
#
#KREJECT=#

 within a distance of  REJECT  angstrom of a peak already ranked on
 peak height, will be rejected from the list.

#HSsuperpose#
#P(Issue 7 - implementation incomplete, 1984)
#P(Issue 9 - implementation still incomplete, 1993 - no one seems to want it
 anyway!- use SHELXS if you need to).
#P(Issue 10 - still no change, 1996)
#PThe Fourier routine provides a way of
 calculating superposition minimum functions.
 For each map that is produced, it is possible to specify that another
 map should be read in from magnetic tape at the same time (the  TAPES
 directive). Each point of the resulting map is taken as the minimum of
 the newly computed map and that read off the magnetic tape. This output
 map may be written to a second magnetic tape, also by use of the  TAPES
 directive.
#PWhen the input map and the calculated map are superposed, the first
 point calculated and the first point read off the tape are compared,
 the second point calculated and the second point input are compared,
 and so on. This implies that the first point on each map must represent
 the same point in real space for the output map, and that each map must
 contain the same number of points.
 The origin of each map that is to be calculated is altered by
 changing LIST 14 (Fourier limits - section #RLIST14#). For example, 
 if a 2x, 2y, 2z vector has been identified
 at 0.36, 0.14 and 0.28, and the 2x, 1/2-2y, 0 vector resulting from a
 two-fold axis has been found at 0.36, 0.36, 0, then the two LIST 14's
 for the superposition function might appear as :
#N  19#
#J
 \LIST 14

 END
#
#PFor the first map, the origin of real space is at 0.18, 0.07 and 0.14
 in vector space. This point is moved so that it is one grid point
 in along each axial direction, to allow for the map scan.
 For the second peak, the origin in real space is at 0.18, 0.18 and 0.0.
 The second LIST 14 places this point one grid point in along each of the
 axial directions so that the real space origin of the two maps
 coincides. To convert the coordinates that result from the second map
 scan to real space coordinates, it is necessary to subtract 0.18
 from x and 0.18 from y, since the coordinates are printed in
 Patterson space for all the maps calculated.

#PThis routine eliminates
 atoms or peaks which duplicate other entries in an atomic

 When using this routine, a set of distances is calculated about each
 atom or peak in turn. Atoms or peaks further down the list than the
 current pivot are then eliminated if they have a contact distance less
 than a user specified maximum (the  REJECT  parameter).
 Thus, when peaks have been added to a
 LIST 5, the peaks corresponding to the atoms can be eliminated.

#PA Slant Fourier is one that is calculated through any general plane
 of the unit cell. For such a Fourier, the normal Beevers-Lipson
 expansion of the summation cannot be used, so that it
 will take many orders of magnitude longer than a
 conventional one.
 The algorithm adopted here is as follows :
#N  28#
#J
 X    A general vector expressed in fractions of the
     unit cell edges (i.e. x/a, y/b and z/c)
 XO   The centroid of the required general fourier section,
     also expressed in crystal fractions.
 XP   The coordinates of the point 'X' when expressed
     in the coordinate system used to define the
     plane of the general section.
 'X' and 'XP' are related by the expression :  XP = R.(X-XO)
 R    'R' is the matrix that describes the transformation
     of a set of coordinates in the crystal system to
     a set of coordinates in the required plane.
 therefore :  X = S.XP + XO

     'S' is the inverse matrix of 'R'.

 The required expression in the fourier is :

     H'.X = H'.S.XP + H'XO

 H    H is a vector containing the Miller indices of
     a reflection and H' is the transpose of H.
 This may be re-expressed as :

     H'.X = H'.S.DXP + H'.(S.XPS + XO)

 DXP  'DXP' represents the increment in going from the
     first point on the section to be calculated.
 XPS  'XPS' is the coordinate of the first point on the
     section to be calculated.
     obviously :  XP = XPS + DXP.
#
#PWhen the Fourier is calculated, the term _I{H'.(S.XPS _I{+ _I{XO)
 is constant for each section to be calculated. The term _I{H'.S ,
 which may be regarded as the transformed indices, is also constant
 for each reflection, so that a two dimensional recurrence relation
 may be used to change  _I{DXP  and thus  _I{Cos(2*PI*H.X _I{- _I{ALPHA)' over
 the required section for each reflection. ( _I{ALPHA  is the phase
 angle for the current reflection).

#PThe distance angles routine is completely
 general with respect to crystal and lattice symmetry.
 For distances, the user may either use elemental radii specified in
 LIST 29 (see section #RLIST29# for input details), or specify  minimum and 
 maximum limits,
 and the program then calculates all possible contacts within these
 limits.
 All symmetry operations and unit cell translations are automatically
 generated.
 For the angles, LIST 29 or a separate set of distance limits may be used.
 At a given atom, angles are then calculated between all the atoms
 which bond to the central atom within the given limits.
#PThe distance-angles routines can calculate the estimated
 standard deviations of the distances and angles that they produce.
 These e.s.d.'s are based upon the matrix stored in LIST 11 (see section
 #RLIST11#), and
 as many variance and covariance terms as are present are used.
 (For a full matrix, therefore, the full variance-covariance matrix
 is used).
 For this reason, the calculation of e.s.d.'s
 takes at least ten times as long
 as a simple distance angles calculation.
#PWhen  a set of e.s.d.'s are calculated, the variance-covariance matrix
 for the cell parameters (LIST 31, section #RLIST31#) may also be used.

#PThe  best  plane for a series of  N
 atoms whose positions have varying reliability, such that they can
 be assigned weights, w(1), w(2), . . . w(n), is defined as
 that for which
 the sum of the squares of the distances (in angstroms) of the
 atoms from the plane, multiplied by the weights, w(i), of
 the atomic positions, is a minimum.
 Note that the normal to the 'worst plane' is the 'best line',
 and if masses are used for weights, then the calculation gives the
 principal inertial axes.
#PThe atomic positions are taken from LIST 5, possibly modified by
 symmetry information, to compute
 inertial axes & deviations of atoms from  the planes or lines.
#PEach time a line or plane
 is computed, the direction cosines of the relevent axis are stored as AXIS
 number 'n'. The dihedral angles between these axes can be computed.
 Three geometry indices are also
 computed. The geometry is best described by the index closest to unity.

#PTLS. This routine calculates the overall rigid-body
 motion tensors T, L, S (Shoemaker and Trueblood, Acta Cryst. B24,
 63, 1968) by a least-squares fit to the individual anisotropic
 temperature factor components, together with librational corrections
 to bond lengths and angles.
#PShoemaker and Trueblood's conventions and reductions
 are followed throughout; in particular, the trace of S, which is
 indeterminant, is set to zero. The program therefore determines
 20 overall tensor components - the upper triangles of T and L
 together with the whole of S apart from S(33). (See also:
 Johnson in Crystallographic Computing, 
 ed R.Ahmed, Munksgaard, 1970, pp 207-219)
#PEven when the trace-of-S singularity has been removed, however,
 the nature of the rigid body problem is such that ill-conditioned
 and singular normal matrices are much more common than in
 structure refinement and the program therefore proceeds via
 the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the normal matrix.  In most
 cases the largest and smallest eigenvalues are output for
 inspection, but if the ratio of these quantities is less than
 the LIMITing RATIO, a full eigenvalue/vector listing is produced. Further,
 if any eigenvalue is itself less than the LIMITing VALUE, the corresponding
 parameter combination is set to zero, thus removing the near-
 singularity. These actions can be modified by the use of the
 LIMIT  and  REJECT  directives described below. If the TLS calcuation 
 cannot be stabilised by means of these filters, the user can modify 
 either T, L or S directly before applying the REPLACE or PUNCH 
 commands. Though here is some danger in this, especially if the supposed rigid 
 group is infact flexible, it may be preferable to using a model 
 yielding negative vibrational or librational amplitudes.

#PCalculation of the torsion angles for atoms i,j,k,l. 
 The torsion angle about the bond j-k
 is the angle the bond i-j is rotated about j-k to bring it into 
 coincidence with k-l.
 It is positive when  the rotation is
 clockwise on looking from j to k.
#PThe program uses atomic positions taken from
 LIST 5.  These can be
 modified by the space group symmetry operators stored in LIST 2 (space
 group information, see section #RLIST02#)
#P EDSs (SUs) are computed by the method of Nardelli (using code given 
 to us from his program PARST) if only average atomic esds are 
 avaialble.  If the full VcV matrix is avaiable, they are computed by 
the method of Schaik et al (R. van Schaik, H Berendsen, A Torda & W 
Gunsteren, J. Mol. Biol. (1993) 234, 751-762. The paper by U. Shmueli, 
Acta Cryst (1974) A30, 848-849 explains the need for the full vcv matrix 
and the effect of symmetry. The singularity in his equations (6) when tau is 
0 or 180 is circumvented in Schaiks formulation (which is singular if

 The output is in two halves, the first
 containing  the positional coordinates and any isotropic temperature factors,
 and the  second containing all the anisotropic temperature parameters.
#PFor the first part, a page is split into 6 separate  fields.
  The first field
 is blank, and is an offset so that the information  is  centred on
 the page.  The remaining fields contain the atom type and serial
 number, the  three positional parameters, and a temperature factor.
 This will be the value of U(iso) with its e.s.d for isotropic atoms,
 otherwise U(equiv), without an e.s.d, for anisotropic atoms.
 U(equiv) _B{is _B{not simply related to the
 diagonal elements of U(aniso), and may be computed as either the
 arithmetic or geometric mean of the principal axes of the ellipsoid.
 See \SET UEQUIV in the chapter on IMMEDIATE commands.
 The width of each type of field may be altered by the user, using
 respectively the  INSET ,  ATOM-NAME , and  NCHARACTER  parameters.  The
 default length
 of a page of this type of output is that required for A4 paper.
#PThe second part contains the anisotropic temperature factors, and each page
 is split into eight fields.
 As for the atomic coordinates, the first field is blank and represents
 an offset.
 The second field contains the atom type and serial number, and
 the remaining six fields contain the components of the anisotropic
 temperature factors.
 The width of each type of field may be adjusted by the user, using
 respectively the  INSET ,  ATOM-NAME  and  NCHARACTER  parameters.
 If a different value for  INSET  or  ATOM-NAME  is required in the
 first and second parts of the output, the job must be run twice.
 Depending upon the width across the page, the second part of the output
 occupies one sheet of A4 paper either across the page or down the page.
#PFor both types of output, the user can select double spacing
 down the page with the  DOUBLE  parameter.
 Similarly for each of the numeric fields, the user can choose the number
 of decimal places to be printed
 (the  NDECIMAL  parameter),
 and whether the numbers are printed as integers or in floating point
 with a decimal point.
 (The  FLOATING  parameter).
 The e.s.d.'s are printed to the same accuracy as the atomic parameters,
 so that if the chosen field is too small and an e.s.d. appears to be
 zero, it will be omitted in exactly the same way as for a parameter
 that has not been refined.
 A parameter printed with 4 decimal places might thus appear as :
#N   5#
#J
 0.0123(4)
 OR
    123(4)
#
 Depending upon the format.
 In either case, the numbers are right justified in their field.
#PAs an alternative to the user selecting the number of decimal
 places that should be printed, it is possible to get the program
 to choose the number of decimal places required for each parameter
 automatically.
 (The  CHOOSE  parameter).
 If the parameters are to be printed in floating point, the number
 of decimal places is chosen so that the e.s.d. Can be represented
 as a one digit number in the last decimal place.
 For numbers that are to be printed as integers, the field used
 is never less than that given by the  NDECIMAL  parameter.
 If the required field is larger than that defined by these 
s,
 a decimal point is inserted and the required number of extra digits
 is output.
 For example, if the number of decimal places required is four, but the e.s.d.
 is too small, it would appear as :
#N   3#
#J
 0.12345(6)
 OR
  1234.5(6)
#
 Depending upon whether floating point or integer output was required.
 For either type, if the parameter has not been refined, the number of
 decimal places is that given by the  NDECIMAL  instruction.
#PSince this routine prints the e.s.d.'s, it is vital that the least squares
 matrix (LIST 11, see section #RLIST11#) belongs to the current 
 LIST 5 (the model parameters). If LIST 5 has been modified
 in any way since the last Least Squares, this routine will abort.

#DCheckCIF#
  CheckCIF and other validators are continuously updated to meet the 
 changing needs of the community. It is unlikely that a CRYSTALS .cif 
 will pass all checks first time, and edits may be necessary to 
 accommodate special situations. Some of these have been foreseen, and the 
 .cif contains possible alternative texts as 'comments'. These can be 
 found by searching for the text 'choose'.
#DReferences#
 The SCRIPT directory contains two text files that contain information 
 copied into the cif file. The user may edit them.
#KRefcif.dat#
   This file is copied in its entirety to the head of the cif file. If 
 it is edited, care must be taken to follow the rules about text 
 delimiters.
#KReftab#
    This is a loosely formatted file containing the references to be 
transcribed into the cif. 
#PEvery reference is composed of 2 parts - a short text used as a data 
 item in the cif, and the full reference. The two parts must be kept 
 together, be separated from each other by a blank line, and be separated 
 from any other item by a blank line. 
#J
      n  a four-digit number giving the number of references to follow. 
         Other text on the line is ignored.
Next items repeated 'n' times:
      m  a three digit number preceded by a 'hash' symbol used as an 
         identifier for the reference. The numbers must be unique, not 
         necessarily in any order, with the largest one equal to 'n'
      
      The full reference. References are put in the file in alphabetic 
      order.
#
 Items 001 to 004 are associated with the keywords 'unknown' for the 
 corresponding items in LIST 30 (see section #RLIST30#), and thus 
 enable the user to insert 
 their own references. Don't forget to move them to their correct 
 alphabetical place.
      
#De.s.d.s#
 The esds output in CIF files try to follow the 'Rule of 19', as
requested by Acta Cryst.
Syd Hall, former Editor for Acta C, summarised the rule as follows:
#P
'This method of handling the su (esd) values has been in force
with Acta since about 1984 apparently. In my time it came up for
discussion about two years ago (1996) and after much to-ing and fro-ing
it was readopted as the preferred level of precision for su's.
#P
What it means is as follows....
#J
(1) if one adopts esd values to one digit precision (rule of 9) the values

      5.548(1)      1.453(2)  3.921(3)  1.2287(8)  are acceptable.

(2) if one permits two digits precision with a limit of 19 (rule of 19)...

      5.5483(9)     1.4532(16)  3.921(3)  1.2287(8)  are acceptable.

(3) if one permits two digits precision with a limit of 29 (rule of 29)...

      5.5483(9)     1.4532(16)  3.9214(28)  1.2287(8)  are acceptable.

#
The object of this approach is to provide a more consistent distribution
of precision across all values. These particular matters are not really
my responsibility but we try to conform to recommendation of the
nomenclature people. This is one such occasion.'

observations made from the _b{whole reciprocal lattice.

#PIt is assumed that sufficient reflections are measured to give a

(called the major) component of the twinned crystal.

#ITLQS twins#
#P  Some, but possibly not all, of the reflections from the major
component contain contributions from other twin components.  Overlap is
controlled by accidental relationships between cell parameters. If the
relationship is very exact, so that all reflections are overlapped, the
sample is a _b{pseudo _b{TLS twin.
#ITLS twins#
#P Every reflection from the major component contains a

controlled by the crystal class rather than accidental relationships
between cell parameters.

#Q
#ITwinning - Data collection and processing#
#Q
#P
     a.
#Q
There is usually no difficulty in collecting data for TLS twins.
For TLQS twins, each observation needs to be tagged to indicate which
twin components (elements) contribute to the observation. This may be
simply computed from the indices if the different lattices have a
more-or-less exact relationship between them, of may need to be assigned
more carefully if the twin obliquity causes only partial overlapping of
some reflections. For doublet spots, it is important that either the
whole doublet is integrated (tag '12'), or the principal component is
separated out (tag '1').
#Q
#P
      b.
#Q
There may be serious difficulties in determining the space
group. Trial and error may be the only procedure available.
#Q
#P
      c.
#Q
 The space group used for data reduction  (section #RDATAREDUC#)
 and merging may not be
that of the major component. A Space group showing the symmetry of the
twinned diffraction data should be used initially. The correct space group
should be used once data reduction is complete.
#Q
#ITwinning - Structure solution#

      In general, structure solution is the major difficulty in working
with twinned crystals.
#P
      a.
#Q
For TLQS structures, if a substantial number of reflections are
from the major component only, the structure may solve by traditional
methods.
#Q
#P
      b.
#Q
For Class I TLS structures, structure solution is usually
straight forward, the components of the twin differing only by the
effects of anomalous scattering. Such twins (merohedral twins, or
twinning by inversion) can be processed without further reference to this
part of the manual. All that needs to be refined is the Flack
enantiopole parameter. See the main chapter on refinement.
#Q
#P
      c.
#Q
For Class II TLS structures, if the twin ratio is far from 50:50, the
structure may solve by traditional methods.
#Q
#ITwinning - Structure Refinement#

      If the space group, trial structure, twin law and reflection
components are known, this is straight forward. The sum of the twin
fractions must be 1.0

#Q
#ITwin Data stored by CRYSTALS#
#P
      For a twinned crystal the following equation holds.
#J
      Fsq(obs) = v1.Fsq(1) + v2.Fsq(2) ....
#
and similarly for F(calc). The v(i) are the volume fractions of the
components contributing to the observation. A Fourier synthesis using /Fobs/ as
coefficient is meaningless, since the phase alpha(calc) will belong to
only one of the components. The terms needed for Fourier and other
calculations are Fcalc(1), alpha(1) Fobs.vol-fract(1), i.e. only that
 contribution to Fo due to the principal element.

#P
For a twin with two components, each observation may contain a
contribution from each component, or from both. The reflections have to
be 'tagged' to indicate which components are contributing, the ELEMENT
coefficient in LIST 6  (section #RLIST06#)

#P
For a TLS twin, every observation contains a contribution from both
components (though if it is a systematic absence for one component, the
contribution will be zero). Since the tagging is the same for every
reflection, it can be inserted automatically by CRYSTALS

#P
For a TLQS twin, some observations will contain a contribution from the
principal component, and some from both components, giving ELEMENT tags
of '1' and '12' respectively. If additional observations have been made
based on the reciprocal lattice of component 2, and are indexed with
respect to lattice 2, they are given the tag '2'. If any of these
also contain a contribution from component 1, the tag will be '21'.

#P
Example 1. An orthorhombic space group with a~b, twinned by interchange
of 'a' and 'b'. If 'a' is very similar to 'b', every observation 'hkl' will
overlap with  twin component 'khl', and the ELEMENT tag will be '12',
the default. If a systematic absence from element 1 falls on element 2,
the reflection should not be eliminated during data reduction, and will
have the tag '12', even though the contrinbution from 1 is zero.

#P
Example 2. A monoclinic crystal with 2cCos(beta)/a about 1/3. Twinning
by a 2 fold rotation about 'a' gives a twin law
#J
        1   0   0
        0  -1   0
      -1/3  0  -1
#
Overlap of reflections from both components will only occur when 'h' =
3n, giving the ELEMENT tag '12'. If the lattice is only sampled at r.l.
points corresponding to the principal indexing, reflections with 'h' #
3n will have the tag '1'.
#Q
#ITwinning - LISTS affected#

#ITwin List 6#
#Q
For TLQS twins, the element tags (section #RLIST06#)
really depend upon exact experimental conditions, and should be computed
by the data collection software. If a reflection is entered without a
twin element tag (eg a SHELX HKL 4 file),
CRYSTALS tries to compute the tag from the twin laws
as follows:
#J
      h      the index with respect to LIST 1 (cell) and LIST 2 (space group)
             (this is the index in LIST 6)
      T      The twin law matrix.
      n      the nominal index for the twinned reflection.
             n = T.h
      d      the difference between an exact lattice point and the
             generated point.
             n-nint(n)
      s      The length**2 of the difference vector, in A-2.

#
#PIf 's' is less than the TWINTOLERANCE given on the LIST 6 MATRIX
directive, the twinned reflection is regarded as falling upon a primary
element reflection, and the element tag is updated to indicate this.

centring of the cell matches for all twin components. Twin elelemt tags
may be provided by an external program, or computed by CRYSTALS.

#ITwinning - Mathematical aspects#


 In a twinned crystal, two or more separate components or  ELEMENTS
 contribute to the diffraction pattern,
 and the observed intensities may
 contain contributions from any one of the possible twin component
 In addition, the amount of each twin component
 present in a specified unit of volume is not restricted, and in
 general will vary between different samples of the same
 material.
#P
 The expression for an observed intensity in such a case
 is given by :
#J
 It = v1*I1 + v2*I2 + . . + vn*In
#
 Where  _i{It  is the total observed intensity to which _i{N
 components contribute,  _i{Ii  is the intensity of component  _i{i ,
 and  _i{vi  is the amount of component  _i{i  present in a given
 volume.
 The  _i{vi  are known as the 'component scale factors', and
 are conventionally taken to be
 the amount of the given component present in a unit volume of the
 crystal, so that :
#J
 SUM(vi) = 1      over all the components.
#
 When a set of reflection data is handled for a twinned crystal,
 it is thus necessary to know which of the possible components
 contribute to the current reflection, and
 to be able to generate the indices
 of each of the components from a set
 of indices given in a standard reference system.
 If the indices of an component in its own reference system are
 given by the vector
  Hc  and those in the standard system by  H , the necessary
 interconversion is given by :
#J
 Hc = R.H
#
 R  is a rotation matrix that describes the transformation
 of the indices.
 (The generation of the various sets of indices can be thought of
 as a rotation centred on the origin).
 The indices  Hc  are of necessity integers, but the components of
  H  may in general take any value.
#PThe interconversion of atomic coordinates between the various
 reference systems in a twinned crystal can also be expressed
 in terms of  R  :
#J
 Hc[T].Xc = H[T].X      for any component.
#
 Where  X  is the coordinate vector for any atom in the standard
 reference system,  Xc  is the coordinate vector for the
 same atom in the reference system for one of the components and
  H[T]  indicates  H  transposed.
 The above expression may be rewritten as :
#J
 H[T].R[T].Q.X = H[T].X
#
 Where  Q  is the matrix that converts the atomic coordinates.
 Therefore :
#J
 R[T].Q = I
#
 Where  I  is the unit matrix.
 The matrix  Q  is thus given by:
#J
 Q = R[TI]
#
 Where  R[TI]  indicates  R  transposed and inverted.
 The coordinates therefore transform as :
#J
 Xc = R[TI].X
#
#PBefore any reflections can be processed, the matrices  R  must
 be provided.
 These are given in LIST 25, which must contain one matrix for
 each possible component.
 (If the standard system is chosen as that of component 1, for example,
 the first  R  matrix will be the unit matrix, which must be given
 as it is not assumed).

#PMOLAX is used for computing the principal axes of inertia
 through groups of atoms using  the routines described in
 Computing Methods in Crystallography, edited by J. S. Rollett,
 Pergamon Press, 1965, p67-68.
 It can be used to compute best lines and planes, and produce simple line
 printer plots of the atoms.
#PThe  best  plane for a series of  N
 atoms whose positions have varying reliability, such that they can
 be assigned weights, w(1), w(2), . . . w(n), is defined as
 that for which
 the sum of the squares of the distances (in angstroms) of the
 atoms from the plane, multiplied by the weights, w(i), of
 the atomic positions, is a minimum.
 Note that the normal to the 'worst plane' is the 'best line',
 and if masses are used for weights, then the calculation gives the
 principal inertial axes.
#PThe atomic positions are taken from LIST 5, possibly modified by
 symmetry information, to compute
 inertial axes, deviations of atoms from  the planes or lines, and the
 angles between normals to these planes or axes. Shape indices (Mingos M.P.
 and Rohl A.L. J Chem Soc Dalton Trans (1991) 3419) are computed.
#PEach time a line or plane
 is computed, the direction cosines of the relevent axis are stored as AXIS
 number 'n'. The angles between these axes can be computed.
 Three geometry indices are also
 computed. The geometry is best described by the index closest to unity.

 cases the largest and smallest eigenvalues are output for

#P This procedure is currently unsupported. It is kept in the code 
 because it offers an opportunity for a new programmer to experiment with
 improved 'COST' functions.
#PAt some stage during a structure determination, the orientation
 of a group of atoms may be known, but not their position in the
 unit cell.
 The routine described in this section provides a rapid method of
 calculating structure factors for a group of atoms at a series of
 points that fall on a grid in the unit cell.
 The algorithm used is similar to that employed in the slant fourier,
 (see the section of the user guide on 'Fourier routines') and is as
 follows :
#PThe  A  part of the structure factor for the reflection with indices
 given by the vector  H  may be written as :
#J
       A(H) = SUM[ G.SUM[ COS2PI(H'.S.X + H'.T) ] ]
#
 With a similar expression for the  B  part.
 ( G  Is the required form factor, modified by the temperature factor
 expression).
 Conventionally, the inner sum runs over the various symmetry operators
 that define the space group, and the outer sum runs over the number of
 atoms in the asymmetric unit.
 However, if the summation order is changed, it is possible to
 accumulate sums for all the atoms for each symmetry position :
#J
       P(H,S) = SUM[ G.COS2PI(H'.S.X + H'.T) ]
#
 With a similar expression for  Q(H,S)  for the  B  part.
 It is now possible to use a recurrence relationship for  P
 and  Q  to give :
#N   5#
#J
       P(H,S,2) = P(H,S,1)*2*COS2PI(H'.S.DX) - P(H,S,0)
 and
       Q(H,S,2) = Q(H,S,1)*2*COS2PI(H'.S.DX) - Q(H,S,0)
#
 P(H,S,0)  Is the original value of  P  for the symmetry position  S
 for the reflection given by  H .
  P(H,S,1)  Is the corresponding value of  P  after a vector  DX  has
 been added to each set of coordinates, and  P(H,S,2)  is the
 corresponding term after a vector  2*DX  has been added.
 Similar relationships hold for the  Q  terms.
 After the initial eight cosine and sine terms have been calculated,
 it is possible to calculate structure factors very rapidly
 as the group of atoms is moved about the unit cell,
 using the relationships given above.
#PApart from an array to hold each section through the unit cell,
 it is necessary to store the eight cosine and sine terms, together
 with the three step vector cosines, for each reflection for each
 symmetry position.
 Because this imposes certain storage limitations, it is necessary
 to restrict the number of reflections that are used.
 In practice it is only the large reflections that must agree, and so
 the user is required to input a minimum Fo value, below which
 reflections are not used.
 The function that is displayed for each grid point is given by :
#J
       SCALE*SUM[ Fo*Fc ]
#
 Accordingly, the largest value printed represents the most likely
 solution.
 The  SCALE  term may be calculated by the program to give numbers in
 a reasonable range, or input by the user.
 The time for each calculation is proportional to the number of
 reflections used, the number of symmetry operators in LIST 2,
 and the number of grid points calculated.
 (A calculation in a non-centro space group takes twice as long as a
 calculation in the corresponding centro space group).
 The atoms to be moved around are taken directly from LIST 5.
#I\TRIAL#
#PThis is the command which initiates the routine to calculate
 structure factors for a group of trial models.
#DMAP Fo-MIN SCALE MIN-RHO#
#PThis directive determines which reflections will be used in the
 calculations and how the map will be printed.
#KFo-MIN#
 This parameter is the minimum value of Fo that a reflection must
 have if it is to be used (this number must be on the scale of Fo).
 If this parameter is omitted, a value of zero is assumed.
#KSCALE#
 If  SCALE  is equal to zero, its default value, the program will
 choose a scale factor that places all the numbers on
 a reasonable scale for printing.
 If this parameter is greater than zero, the sum of Fo*Fc
 is multiplied by  SCALE  before it is printed.
 (The scale factor computed by the program is dependent upon
 the origin chosen for the group of atoms, so that
 successive maps with different origins will be on different
 scales, unless this parameter is specified for all the maps
 after the first).
#KMIN-RHO#
 This parameter is a cut-off value, such that all numbers less than
  MIN-RHO  are printed as zero. If this parameter is absent, a
 default value of zero is assumed, which means that all the points
 are printed.
#DDISPLACEMENT DELTA-X DELTA-Y DELTA-Z#
#PThis directive defines a vector which is added to each set of
 coordinates in LIST 5 before the structure factor calculation
 starts.  DELTA-X ,  DELTA-Y  And  DELTA-Z  thus correspond
 to an initial origin shift for the group in LIST 5.
#KDELTA-X#
 The shift along the x-direction.
#KDELTA-Y#
 The shift along the y-direction.
#KDELTA-Z#
 The shift along the z-direction.
#PThe default values for these parameters are zero, indicating no
 initial origin shift before the structure factor calculation.
