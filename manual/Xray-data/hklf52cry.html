    <h1>hkl52cry</h1>
  </div>Twinned crystals are ones in which two (or more) parts have different
  orientations. Unlike accidental intergrowths, the unit cells of the components of a
  twin are related to each other in a rational way, so that the indices of reflections
  from each component are also rationally related by a matrix call the "Twin Law". Each
  part generates its own diffraction pattern. These will also have a rotional
  relationship between them.<br />
  <br />
  <br />

  <div class="c1">
    <h2>CRYSTALS and SHELX</h2>
  </div>The reflection format for twinned data is different in CRYSTALS and SHELX. The
  program hklf52cry converts a SHELX reflection file (hklf 5 format) to a standard
  CRYSTALS format (LIST 6). The program also tries to extract the twin laws based on the
  indices of groups of overlapping reflections.<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  CRYSTALS and SHELXL both refine composite crystals (usually twins) by the method of C.
  T. Grainger and J. F. McConnell. ( <i>Acta Cryst. (1969). B25, 1962</i>). In the
  absence of interference between the diffracted beams from each component of the twin,
  the observed intensity is the volume-fraction weighted sum of the overlapping
  intensities from the twin components.<br />
  Io=&#931;c<sub>i</sub>I<sub>i</sub><br />
  where c<sub>i</sub> is the vol-fraction of component <i>i</i>, and I<sub>i</sub> its
  unobservable intensity. The c<sub>i</sub> can be estimated by replacing the observed
  I<sub>i</sub> with their calculated equivalents. The c<sub>i</sub> should sum to
  unity.<br />

  <div class="c1">
    <h2>Experimental Considerations</h2>
  </div>The diffraction image for a sample consisting of two parts will consist of
  overlapping diffraction patterns from each component. The instrument software will have
  to try to assign each diffracted spot to one lattice or the other, or both
  simultaneously, and hence assign one or two indices to each spot. Each lattice will
  have its own orientation matrix.<br />
  If the sample is really twinned, there will be a geometric relationship between the
  orientation of the two patterns in three dimensions. This relationship is the Twin Law,
  and must be determined when the diffraction images are being processed.<br />
  If the sample is not really twinned, but is just two crystallites grown together, the
  instrument may still be able to assign orientation matrices to the two lattices, but
  they will not be related in a rational way.<br />
  The output reflection file will consist of a list of the observed intensities together
  with information about the indices of the reflections contributing to the total
  intensity. CRYSTALS and SHELX use different ways of representing this relationship.

  <div class="c1">
    <h2>Differences between CRYSTALS and SHELXL</h2>
  </div>

  <h3>CRYSTALS</h3>The crystal is regarded as being composed of a principal and a minor
  component. The reflection file consists of the index of the principal component, the
  total measured intensity, and a flag indicating whether the minor component also
  contributes to the intensity.
  <pre>
e.g.
h k l intensity sigma 1
</pre>indicates a contribution from only the primary component
  <pre>
h k l intensity sigma 12
</pre>indicates a contribution from both components. The index of the second component
(which is needed in order to determine its calculated intensity) is obtained by
multiplying the given index by the twin law matrix. The concept can be extended to a
sample consisting of up to nine components.

  <h3>SHELX</h3>Twinned data is input into SHELXL by the instruction:<br />
  hklf 5<br />
  The reflection file consists of groups of lines all referring to a single observed
  intensity.
  <pre>
e.g.
h k l intensity sigma m
</pre>hkl is the index corresponding to component <i>m</i>.<br />
  When both twin components contribute to a single observed intensity they are grouped
  together:
  <pre>
h  k  l  intensity sigma -1
h' k' l' intensity sigma  2
</pre>The intensity and sigmas have the same values on both lines. hkl is the index of
the principal component, h'k'l' the index of the minor component, indicated by the
<i>2</i> at the end of the line.<br />
  Since the index of the minor component is given explicitly, SHELX does not need to know
  the twin law, and in fact the two components neesd not be related by a twin law.<br />

  <p><strong>Classification</strong></p>

  <p>Early classifications were made on the basis of morphology, measured with contact or
  optical goniometers. The fine details of this scheme and the nomenclature, though
  useful for describing individual twins, are probably not useful for structure analysts.
  Classification based on the reciprocal lattice are simpler. Note that there is a rather
  inconsistent use of classification schemes in the literature. A fundamental division
  for the structure analyst is the distinction between twins in which every observable
  reciprocal lattice point contains contributions from both twin components, and those
  twins in which some points contain contributions from one component only.</p>

      <strong>TLQS twins</strong> have multiple diffraction patters. The
      &#8216;spots&#8217; may be split, or give two distinct lattices.<br />

      <table width="100%" border="3" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
        <tr>
          <td width="50%">In the central (horizontal) row the diffraction spots from two
          lattices overlap exactly. In the first row above, the two lattices give rise to
          separate diffaction spots (white arrows for one lattice, blue for the other).
          On the next row the spots are (in this example) almost evenly spaced. By the
          4<sup>th</sup> row the spots are again overlapping.<br />
          TLQS twins are normally evident from the diffraction images. The instument must
          decide how to process the images.<br />
          In this case the intensities of reflections on the zeroth and fourth rows are
          the sums of both lattices. On the first and second rows the two components are
          well resolved and can be estimated separately. On the third row the splitting
          is marginal, and the instrument will have to choose for itself whether to
          agregate the contributions, or whether it can resolve them.</td>

      <strong>TLS twins</strong>show a single diffraction pattern.

              <li><strong>Class I</strong> (merohedral)<br />
              The twin operator belongs to the Laue symmetry of the untwinned crystal.
              The centre of symmetry can always be chosen as the operator. Except for the
              influence of Friedels Law, the intensities from a twinned sample are the
              same as those from an untwinned sample.<br />
              r.l. of twin has higher symmetry than r.l. of component<br />
              I<sub>t</sub> = vI<sub>1</sub> + (1-v)I<sub>2</sub></li>

              <li><strong>Class II</strong> (pseudo-merohedral)<br />
              The centre of symmetry is never the twin operator. Two reflections not
              equivalent by Laue symmetry contribute to a single observation.<br />
              r.l. of twin has same symmetry as r.l. of component.</li>

            i and ii represent the diffraction patterns from each of two components (each
            with symmetry <i>2</i>) related by a 2-fold rotations about <i>h</i>. If
            there are equal volumes of both component in the twin, the resulting image is
            as in iii. The diffraction image now has <i>mm</i> symmetry, which could lead
            to difficulties in determining the space group. If the volumes are unequal,
            the symmetry remains <i>2</i>. Note that in 3 there are more strong spots in
            i and ii. This gives rise to an unusual distribution of E values
            (&lt;|E<sup>2</sup>-1|&gt;&nbsp;~0.74) and several values of F<sub>o</sub>
            substantially greater than F<sub>c</sub>.
