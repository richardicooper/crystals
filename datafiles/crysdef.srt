# Startup file for DEFINE
#  $Log: not supported by cvs2svn $
#  Revision 1.10  2003/09/29 15:38:34  rich
#  Added \DEFINE system instruction for building the command file. No
#  need for separate executable anymore. This command is \REMOVEd in
#  the normal startup file to prevent accidents.
#
#  Revision 1.9  2003/05/07 12:18:53  rich
#
#  RIC: Make a new platform target "WXS" for building CRYSTALS under Windows
#  using only free compilers and libraries. Hurrah, but it isn't very stable
#  yet (CRYSTALS, not the compilers...)
#
#  Revision 1.8  2003/01/16 11:32:07  rich
#  Cosmetic changes - more useful output during DSC building, and pauses at
#  the end.
#
#  Revision 1.7  2001/07/15 08:13:58  ckp2
#  Spaces after #'s to appease the linux version. In the long run this should
#  be run through the editor before use, as that would remove the spurious DOS EOL
#  characters that upset the linux version. (In fact if I cvs'ed it directly into linux
#  things should be fine).
#
#  Revision 1.6  2001/06/18 08:23:12  richard
#  Use MIXED case files - under Linux this is essential to allow access to all
#  files and under Windows case doesn't matter.
