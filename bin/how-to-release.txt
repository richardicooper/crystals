QUICKSTART
==========

Type "buildall"
Type "inst"
Release \relbuild\output\output\setup.exe 

SLOWSTART
=========

1a. Set up CVS
    ----------

 Get CVS. CVS is GPL software available from
 http://www.cyclic.com/ 
 http://www.cvshome.org/ 
 http://www.loria.fr/~molli/cvs-index.html

 set CVSROOT=:pserver:crystalsanon@darkstar.xtl.ox.ac.uk\crystals\ 
 cvs login

at the password prompt, just hit return. (Crystalsanon does not have
write access to the repository.)
The firewall on darkstar is very restrictive. Search the file
"fire2" in root's home directory for CVS and add you machine to
the list allowed to connect. Then run "./fire2" to update the firewall.
 

1b. Get and install the setup.exe builder
    --------------------------------------   

 Inno Setup, from http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.htm

1c. Get and install perl
    --------------------

 Perl, from http://www.cpan.org/

2. Checkout out the entire repository to a new release directory
   -------------------------------------------------------------

 mkdir \relsrc
 cd \relsrc
 cvs checkout cryssrc camsrc scriptsrc guisrc bin precomp manual

3. Set the environment 
   -------------------

 mkdir \relbuild

 set COMPCODE=GID
 set CRYSSRC=c:\relsrc
 set CRYSBUILD=c:\relbuild
 set CRYSDIR=c:\relbuild\
 set USECRYSDIR=TRUE

 The path should include the fortran tools, the C++ tools, the development suite tools and
 the repository tools (these paths may differ on your machine):
 NB. c:\relsrc\bin should be before any other \source\bin\ directories on your path.
 
 set path=c:\progra~1\micros~2\df98\bin;%path%
 set path=c:\progra~1\micros~2\vc98\bin;%path%
 set path=c:\progra~1\micros~2\common\msdev98\bin;%path%
 set path=c:\relsrc\bin;%path%
 
 The INCLUDE and LIB variables should be on one line each, they are split here for clarity:

 set INCLUDE=c:\progra~1\micros~2\vc98\include;
              c:\progra~1\micros~2\vc98\mfc\include;
              c:\progra~1\micros~2\df98\include;

 set LIB=c:\progra~1\micros~2\vc98\lib;
         c:\progra~1\micros~2\vc98\mfc\lib;
         c:\progra~1\micros~2\df98\lib;

4. Build the whole lot.
   --------------------

   From any directory, type "buildall".

     FYI, buildall calls the following:
        code.bat     -  builds and links CRYSTALS.
        script.bat   -  processes all the scripts from .ssc to .scp
        local.bat    -  generates all .srt, .dat and .cmn files
        dsc.bat      -  produces commands.dsc
        precomp.bat  -  copies all foreign programs to build folder.
        buildman.bat -  builds the manuals.

5. Test the build thoroughly:
   --------------------------

 Check the linker logs \relbuild\code\link.lis, dlink.lis and deflink.lis
 Check through the error logs in \relbuild\errors
   
 Check that crystals.exe, crystalsd.exe, define.exe, commands.dsc and so on 
 are all present in \relbuild\

 Run the program through various tests. Hexample. It is a good idea to take
 a structure from diffractomer data through to published results.

6. Prepare the setup.exe compiler options:
   ---------------------------------------

 Edit \relsrc\bin\inst.bat and change the following two options to
 suit the current release:
        echo AppVerName=CRYSTALS 11.50 (December 2000)
        echo BackColor=$101268

 ensure that this is the path to the inno setup compiler:
        c:\progra~1\innose~1.3\compil32.exe /cc crystals.iss

 The files instimage.bmp, licence.txt, postinst.txt and preinst.txt may 
 be edited. They are displayed during installation.
 
7.  Quick test 
    ----------

 If you have Perl installed (www.cpan.org), you may run
 "scpcheck.bat" to test for calls from scripts and from guimenu.srt
 to missing scripts.
 This may occur because a new script has not been checked in, or if it
 is missing from script.bat

8.  Build setup.exe
    ---------------

 Run "inst.bat".

 This will delete files from the build directory that are not for release.
 The output setup.exe is placed in the \build\output\output subdirectory.

 Test it before placing on the web-server. Ideally it should be installed
 on a virgin machine, but that isn't always possible.
