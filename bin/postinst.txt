Warning: CRYSTALS is experimental software in beta testing.
It is distributed without charge to academic and not-for-profit
users. The University may one day insist that we charge a
nominal fee for future versions.

The distribution only contains the executables, manuals and essential 
data. Sources may be available by special arrangement.

It is essential that problems and bugs are reported:
        http://www.xtl.ox.ac.uk/bug.html
 
If you have any problems installing or using it then please
drop an email to - david.watkin@chem.ox.ac.uk

We appreciate feedback, good and bad, which can greatly
enhance the development of the program, though we cannot
offer any official support or promise to fix any errors
as quickly as you might like.

Users of ancient versions of CRYSTALS should backup their data
before using the new version, in case they wish to return to the
old version at some point. This is due to a slight difference
in the format of some data lists which means that new DSC files will
not work correctly with the old program. (NB This is not
an insurmountable problem, but it is worth being aware of
it).

The rapid feedback-development cycle, means that the software
will probably be updated frequently. Check back for updates -
see the fixes.html file on the server for details.

Bob Gould in Edinburgh has donated the program SXTOCRY, which
will generate a file in CRYSTALS format from SHELX.INS files. 
SXTOCRY has been superceded by the 'Import SHELX' script in
the File menu in CRYSTALS - this script based on a translation
of Bob's Fortran program into CRYSTALS' scripting language.
It may not work completely for very complex SHELX.INS files,
but it is a quick way to get started in CRYSTALS.

Please note the references for CRYSTALS and CAMERON, and
give them with each structure you publish. In the current difficult 
financial atmosphere in the UK, employers have begun to count the 
numbers of citations for work, as well as publications, so we will 
need clear support from the user community if the work is to continue.
