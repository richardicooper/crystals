                                   NKET
 
This is a complete data set for a small organic structure.

      Formula:          C8 H13 N O4
      Space Group:      P 41
      Unit Cell:        7.533 7.533 15.780
      Z:                4
      Cell Contents:    C32 H52 N4 O16
      Radiation:        Cu
      Reflections:      Fsq in HKLF file NKET.REF, FORMAT(3I4,2F8.0)
      Size:             .2x.2x.7 mm

It will easily solve with SIR, SHELXS or MULTAN.
The primary data from an ENREAF-NONIUS CAD4 is:

            NKET.DAT          the reflection data
            NKET.PSI          the psi profile.
 
The data can be processed through RC93, to give the files:
 
            NKET.HKL          the processed reflection data
            NKET.SCF          the unit cell, scale factors etc.
            NKET.ABS          the processed phi scan.
 
 
      This preprocessed data can be entered into CRYSTALS in SCRIPT mode,
when the dialogue ROUTINE should lead you to solve and refine the structure.
 
      The same data can be entered in COMMAND mode, (as USE files) and
provides a small but interesting test set for getting acquainted with CRYSTALS
facilities. 

      The file NKET.SLX is the result of a SHELXS run, and can be copied to
SHELXS.CRY if you don't wish to run SHELXS but just use the output.
 
      For users migrating from other systems, the folowing files may be run in
the order give as an example of the principal steps.
 
            NKET.QCK          Getting the basic data in
            NKET.LSQ          A bit of refinement
            NKET.ANISO        Sorting out the non-C atoms and aniso refinement
            NKET.FOUR         Looking for hydrogen
            NKET.REF          HKLF format reflections (Fsq)
