This structure (an organic salt) has a twinning problem. Use the
tools (i.e. ROTAX) to work out the twin-law. It is P21/c, but the
twinning makes it look like P21 because the minor component causes
intensity where the c/glide absences should be.

Look at the 'Systematic Absences' tab of the initial analyses to
see this effect in P21/c.

KEEN is usually one of the last workshop structures. You are
keen for getting this far.
