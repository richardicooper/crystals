Thanks
======
We are grateful to Drs. Zoltan Gal and Simon Clarke for allowing this
data to be included in the CRYSTALS distribution. The structure is
published in Inorg. Chem. 2004, 43, 3998-4006. "Synthesis and Structure
of Alkaline Earth Silicon Nitrides: BaSiN2, SrSiN2 and CaSiN2".
Zoltan A. Gal, Phillip M. Mallinson, Heston J. Orchard, and Simon J. Clarke.

Data collection
===============
The data were collected by X-ray diffraction from a single crystal
at 150K, using a Nonius Kappa CCD diffractometer. BaSiN2 crystallises
in the space group C m c a, with Z=8.

Solution
========
The structure will solve in Sir92 or SHELXS, but the second N atom
will probably not be located. It will show up clearly in a Fourier
map and the structure will refine anisotropically and with extinction
down to an R1 of about 2.5%.

Structure
=========
The structure consists of pairs of SiN4 tetrahedra edge-linked to form
bow-tie shaped Si2N6 dimers which share vertices to form layers.
