This natty material was supplied as very poor colourless crystals
found congealed in the bottom of a half-abandoned flask.

A fragment of crystal (0.3 x 0.4 x 0.4 mm) was mounted in oil
on a KCCD diffractometer at 190K and  a data set collected in two hours.

Structure contains one cycloproyl ring, from which its nickname is derived.
     
Data has been put into SHELX format (cyclo.ins and cyclo.hkl).
