LLewellyn

This material was prepared by Simon Llewellyn in Oxford.  
It was in the form of small dark-red crystalline fragments.  
The data were collected on a Nonius Kccd diffractometer at 150K.  
The expected molecular formula was C22 H22 Co2 O6 P2.  
The unit cell was triclinic with a volume of  615A^3.  
Since the material is expected to be centrosymmetric and the 
cell could contain one molecule, a good starting hypothesis is 
that the space group is P-1 with half a molecule in the asymmetric unit.  

The data is presented as a CRYSTALS ‘Use’ file, plus a standard 
reflection file.
