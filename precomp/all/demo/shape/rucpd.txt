used for one of two workshop sections.

{I When running the TLS workshop:
  the file orig.dsc is copied to crfilev2.dsc and becomes
  the default structure. This is the data in its original
  form. No further action is needed.

{I For the special electron density shapes demo:
  The structures in NEWISO.dsc, NEWANISO.dsc, and NEWRING.dsc
  are examples of refinement using different models for the
  electron density in the ring. To access these .dsc files,
  choose "Open CRYSTALS DSC file" from the "File" menu.
