C     This is a sample version of the RC93.INI file.  
Any lines beginning with a non blank character are comment lines and are 
ignored.
The diffractometer type is indicated by a code 01.
The format is (1X,I2,2X,A15)  The program variable is CMACH
c     NORMAL            Normal beam Weissenberg geometry
c     EQUI              Equi-inclination Weissenberg geometry
c     ANTI              Anti-equi-inclination Weissenberg geometry
c     PRECESSION        Precession Weissenberg geometry
c     CAD4              Nonius CAD4 diffractometer Eulerian angles

c     FOR THE MOMENT IF THE DIFFRACTOMETER IS NOT KAPPA OR IS LEFT BLANK 
THEN RC93 WILL ISSUE WARNINGS AND STOP

 01  Kappa
C
C     Code 02 indicates whether or not RC93 should capitalise filenames.
This may become important for non DOS and VMS machines.
All inputs except filenames are capitalised within the program.
A zero indicates capitalise filenames, non-zero indicates do not.
The format is (1X,I2,2X,I2).  The program variable is LCAPPR
 02  01
C
C     Code 03 indicates whether or not the user should be prompted to 
write a new version of a file if that file already exists.  For DOS 
and probably UNIX this should be set to 0 (ie: prompt) to check before 
overwriting an existing file.  For VMS it should be set to 1, because 
the operating system will create a new version and not destroy the old 
one, so the prompt is unnecessary.
C     
C     The format is (1X, I2, 2X, I2)  The program variable is LOVRWR.

c      Code 04 indicates the name and path for the HELP file.  Note that
quotation marks are NOT needed.
The format is 1X, I2, 2X, A80
