    <h1>Packing a Cell with CAMERON</h1>
  </div>Because it is dirctly linked to CRYSTALS, CAMERON can be used to manipulate
  structures. CAMERON can also produce publication quality structural diagrams.<br />
  When a structure is composed of more than one discrete residues, you can use CAMERON to
  select which instances of the symmetry related residues to include in the model.<br />
