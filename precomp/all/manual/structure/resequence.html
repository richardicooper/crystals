 This routine offers another
 way of re-ordering the atoms or Fourier peaks so that
 related atoms or peaks
 form a sequential group in the list, with sequential serial numbers and coordinates which 
 put the atoms as close together as possible.

  It should be used once the main part (or all
  the non-hydrogen atoms) have been located<br />
  <br />

  <div class="c1">
    <h2>Method</h2>
  </div>The first atom is chosen as a pivot and a set of distances is calculated about
 each non-hydrogen  atom or peak in the list in turn.
 For each atom or peak in the list below the current pivot, the
 minimum contact distance is chosen, and if this is less than 
 0.2A+ sum of the covalent radii, the atom or peak is moved up the list to
 a position directly below the pivot.  As well as reordering the list,
 the necessary symmetry operators are
 applied to the positional and thermal parameters to bring the atom
 or peak into the same part of the unit cell as the current pivot
 atom. 

  <br />  <br />
  The next atom after the moved atoms is then made the new pivot and
  the process repeated and repeated until an atom is found which forms no bonds to the
  remaining atoms.  When more than one atom or peak is moved, their relative order is
  preserved as they are inserted behind the current pivot atom.

  <br />  <br />
  If there are no atoms amongst the remainders bonding to the first pivot, the list is
  searched for atoms bonding to the next pivot, and so on and so on until the process is
  exhausted.<br />
  This procedure leads to long chains of adjacent atoms being sequantially connected 
  and re-numbered.

  <br />  <br />
  Hydrogen atoms are not included in this process, but are re-numbered to match their parent atom.

<br />
 
 Isolated parts of the structure are put into different PARTS
