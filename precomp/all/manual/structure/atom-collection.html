    <h1>Atom Collection</h1>
  </div>This module tries to take atoms which are dispersed throughout the unit cell and
  assemble them into bonded clusters.

  <div class="c1">
    <h2>Method</h2>
  </div>Structure solution programs (especially older ones) simply look for peaks in the
  electron density map and call them atoms (or 'Q' peaks in SHELX etc).<br />
  This module uses covalent radii (or a default value for Q-peaks) and the space group
  symmetry operators to bring <i>bonded</i> atoms together.<br />
  The first atom in the atom list (<i>pivot atom</i>) is marked as <i>found</i> and then
  the symmetry operators used on all subsequent <i>not-found</i> atoms to find the
  equivalent position which brings them closest to the pivot. Any atom which is within
  bonding distance plus a user-defined tolerance is marked as found. The first remaining
  not-found atom is now chosen as a new found pivot and the process repeated. The process
  is repeated until atoms are marked as found.<br />
  If an incomplete structure is being extended by Fourier methods, the known structure
  can be marked as found, so that only new peaks are aggregated with the existing
  structure.<br />
  The names and serial numbers of atoms, and their position in the list, are not
  altered.<br />
  <hr color="blue" />
  The procedure is performed twice.<br />
  In the first pass, the tolerance augments the covalent radii by 2.0A. This helps to
  bring separate entities into the same part of the unit cell, but will not get
  physically realistic bonding.<br />
  The second pass uses a default tolerance of 0.2A to build reasonable molecules.<br />
  <hr color="blue" />
  If you have a heavy atom you
  might want to make this the first atom before starting this module. If you know the name
  of this atom, say Zn(1), you can move it to the top of the list by issuing:<br />
  <pre>
#EDIT
MOVE Zn(1)
END
</pre><br />
  If you dont know the name, you can try sorting on the electron count or atomic weight:

  <table border="1">
    <tr>
      <td>
        <pre>
#EDIT
INSERT ELECTRON (or INSERT WEIGHT)
DSORT SPARE     
END
</pre>
      </td>

      <td>The electron count or atomic weight of each atom is inserted into the key
      <i>SPARE</i>.<br />
      DSORT sorts the values in the given key (in this case SPARE) by decreasing value.
      Any key can be sorted, eg DSORT U[iso] would put the atom with the smallest Uiso at
      the top of the atom list.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
