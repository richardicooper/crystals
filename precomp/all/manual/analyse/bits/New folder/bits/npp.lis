<h3> Normal Probability Plot</h3>
<p>
This should be a straight line of unit gradient.  The tails
are often ragged, and not too important if only a few reflections
are involved.  If the line has a significan curve, this means that
there is a significant
trend in the residual which must be corrected either by improving
the model or adjusting the weights. If the curve is more-or-less 
straight but not of unit gradient, the weights need rescalling.
<br> In this case there is a down turn in a few reflections (probably
not too important), and the gradient is about 0.4, indicating that 
the weights need re-scalling.
