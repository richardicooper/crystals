<h3> MOGUL</h3>
<p>
This can only be used if you have the CCDC MOGUL system installed on 
your PC.  It compares the local geometry of your structure with similar 
geometries in the MOGUL data base and alerts you to any significant 
differences (\Z\ values).  Clicking on a featue shows the corresponding 
values stored in MOGUL.  It can be used to set up restraints, where the 
target values and esds are based on the MOGUL values.
