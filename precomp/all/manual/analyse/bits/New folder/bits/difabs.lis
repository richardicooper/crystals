<h3> Difabs</h3>
<p>
The colour-field shows the mean value &lt;Fo/Fc&gt; value as a funcion of 
azimuth and declination of the incident and emergent beams, 
i.e. as a funcion of direction with respect to the crystal shape.

<br><br>
For Area Detector data, multiple observations at different angles are merged,
so the 
azimuth (angle in the h-k plane) and declination (angle above this plane) of the 
scattering vector are used. 


<br><br>The map should be featureless, but 
almost never is.  Steep gradients may indicate problems with the 
structural model or with the data processing (e.g. unsatisfactory 
absorption corrections). The text window shows the maximum, minimum and 
mean values, which in  this case range over +/- 5% and are not very 
significant. (Note that the DIFABS calculation can actually be applied 
in CRYSTALS as a "correction" to the data, but this is not available 
from a menu.)

<br><br>If the figure field is completely black (very little variation) more 
detail can sometimes be seen by plotting the logarithm of the values 
(Press L on the keyboard). 
<br>Pressing / replaces the ratio map with the multiplicity of observation
map. This should show good coverage of the unique part of the reciprocal lattice.
