<h3> Highlighted atoms + TLS</h3>
<p>
Computes the TLS analysis of the selected atoms.  Large values of R1 
indicate thet the selected atoms do not form a rigid group.  Small 
values of R1 plus large values of L<sub>33</sub> indicate thet there may 
be a bond shortening effect.  Look in the listing file to see the 
corrected bond lengths.  In this case the R1 value of 7% and the 
 L<sub>33</sub> value of 70 degree<sup>2</sup> leads to bond length 
corrections of about 0.02A.

<h3> Highlighted atoms + Slant Fourier</h3>
<p>
This computes the best plane through the selected atoms and then the 
electron density (or difference density) in sections parallel to the 
plane. You will probably need to raise the number of sections from the 
default (2) in order to obtain a thicker slab of the structure.  Michael 
Husaks MCE viewer lets you examine the density. <br>
This is a really useful utiity for helping you to unravel disorder.  
Remember that an ordinary peak-search picks out local maxima, but tells 
you nothing about the surrounding density. Set the occupation factors of
the suspicious atoms to zero and then re-compute structure factors 
(<b>Do not try refinement</b>). Then click the solvent atoms to locate 
the area of interest and view the slant difference Fourier. The atoms 
with zero occupancie will not contribute to the map, but will help you
locate the supposed solvent amongst the electron density.<br><br>
