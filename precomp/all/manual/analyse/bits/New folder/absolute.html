  <h3>Determination of Absolute Structure for all-light atom materials using Mo radiation
  is usually problematic. CRYSTALS offers a variety of tools. Consistency amongst the
  results should increase your confidence in the analysis. If there are inconsistencies
  it is likely that there are other problems with the data or the structural model.</h3>

  <p>All materials in a non-centrosymmetric space group will have an absolute
  structure.<br />
  This may arise either because the material is composed of enantiopure chiral molecules
  (eg sucrose) or because achiral entities are arranged into a chiral structure (e.g.
  SiO4 in quartz).<br />
  For non-centrosymmetric achiral materials, the crystal will have one or more polar
  directions which must be correctly assigened if the Polar Axis Dispersion Error is to
  be avoided.<br />
  For non-centrosymmetric chiral crystals, the Absolute Cofiguration of the material can
  be assigned if the absolute structure determination was successful.<br />
  For a quick overview of absolute structurures and configuration, see: <i>X-ray
  crystallography and chirality: understanding the limitations. Amber L. Thompson, David
  John Watkin, Tetrahedron: Asymmetry 20 (2009) 712&ndash;717</i>. The term
  <i>Enantiopole</i>, used in CRYSTALS since 1984, occurs in <i>Gerhard Muller, Acta
  Cryst. (1988). B44, 315-318, Enantiomorph-Polarity Estimation by Means of Flack's x
  Refinement: Practical Experiences.</i></p>

      <td width="50%">
        <p>CRYSTALS has two different refineable parameters to help with the
        determination of absolute structure.<br />
        The oldest, the Rodger's "eta" parameter is a multiplier onto f", and takes the
        value +1 if the model has the correct hand, and -1 if it needs inverting. Flack
        showed that this parameter is unreliable as eta approaches zero.<br />
        <strong>Direct Refinement</strong><br />
        The Flack "x" parameter is the mixing term in<br />
        F<sup>2</sup> = (1-x)F<sup>2</sup>+h + x<sup>2</sup>-h<br />
        and takes the value zero if the model has the correct hand, and +1 if it needs
        inverting.<br />
        Either the Rodger's or Flack parameter should be refined simultaneously with the
        other structural parameters since its value will influence them, and they in turn
        will influence the s.u. on the absolute configuration parameter.<br />
        <strong>Post-refinement Methods</strong> Post-refinement methods analyse the
        Bijvoet differences. Usually they produce more-or-less that same value for the
        Flack parameter as direct refinement, but often with a much reduced esd. It has
        been shown that the larger esd for direct refinement can usually be attributed to
        the weighting scheme used during refinement, which is usually chosen to reflect
        short comings in both the data and the model. <i>Watkin and Cooper, Acta Cryst.
        (2016). B72, 661&ndash;683</i>. The Parsons(q), Hooft(y) and Bijvoet(d)
        parameters and esds are generally very similar, and are the most reliable
        estimators of absolute structure currently available.<br />
        The Hooft, Straver and Spek Probability parameters are robust if the material is
        known to be enantio pure. <i>Hooft, Straver, &amp; Spek, (2008). J. Appl. Cryst.
        41, 96&ndash;103.</i><br />
        <br />
        <strong>Interpreting the Absolute Configuration Parameters</strong><br />
        The interpretation is equally applicable to direct and post-refinement
        methods.</p>

        <p style="font-size:80%">If the s.u. on the Flack parameter is greater than 0.30,
        the X-ray data contain no significant anomalous information so that the absolute
        configuration cannot be assigned by X-ray means. The value of x can be set to
        zero and not refined. (It may be appropriate to report x and its s.u. to
        demonstrate that the calculation was actually performed).<br />
        If the s.u. is small enough (&lt;0.04), then the parameter itself can be
        evaluated. If it falls close to zero or unity, then the absolute configuration
        has been determined. If it falls within this range, but is significantly distant
        from the bounds, the material is probably twinned by inversion.</p>

        For a reliable determination, the number of unpaired reflection should be
        small.<br />
        The ratio of the observed to the computed r.m.s. Bijvoet differences should be
        around unity. It is usually higher. A very large ratio may indicate poor data
        (multiscan absorption correction, crystal decay etc) or that a heavy element may
        be missing from the model.<br />
        The number of Friedel pairs used should be similar to the number found. If many
        have been rejected, this may mean that some of the data has been badly
        measured.<br />
        The number of reflections used in accumulating the scatterplot should similar to
        the number found above. If a large fraction have been omitted, this may mean that
        the anomalous scattering is very weak. Changing the filters to accept more data
        may just introduce rubbish reflections. In particular, if you have to raise the
        value of Filter_2 this may indicate poor data scaling or uncorrected absorption
        effects. <a href="#filters">See Filters, below</a><br />

</pre><br />
        Normal Probability Plot<br />
        The normal probability plot should have unit gradient and zero intercept.<br />
        Values far from unity may mean that there are serious errors in the data, or that
        there is a defect in the model. A few outliers can be expected. Right clicking on
        them causes them to be excluded from (filtered out of) the main refinement. They
        can be re-instated from the Filter menu. Because there are usually outliers at
        the ends of the graph, only points between the first and ninth decile are used in
        computing the gradient.<br />
        <br />
        Principal Component Analysis of the Do Dc scatterplot.<br />
        If the weighted averages of x and y (the plot axes) are far from zero, there may
        be a systematic error in the data or the model<br />
        The larger the rms values, the greater the dispersion of the data. This could
        either be due to a strong anomalous signal, or to a lot of noise. The plot should
        make the choice evident.<br />
        The Roots are the eigenvalues of the scatterplot (Prinicipal Component Analysis).
        For a Do/Dc or Qo/Qc plot them largest root should have an angle (with the
        x-axis) of 45 degrees, in which case the minor root is a measure of the noise. If
        the major root has an angle of about 90 degrees, then the data is mainly
        noise.<br />
        <br />
        For the Do/Dc and Qo/Qc plots the correltaion coefficient and the coefficient of
        determination (R <sup>2</sup>) should be large. Small values mean that the values
        of Do or Qo are not determined by the values of Dc or Qc.<br />
        The slope of the plot should be close to unity, and the intercept close to
        zero.<br />
        The Histogram calculation computes a distribution of the Flack(x) for every
        accepted Bijvoet pair.

      <td width="50%">The statistics for Io and Is should be roughly similar.<br />
      <br />
      The number of reflections for which the residuals for Io and Is have the same sign
      should exceed the number with opposite sign.<br />
      <br />
      The distribtion for Io should be similar to that for Is. For a poorly determined
      absolute structure, the Io distribution is often much wider than the Is
      distribution.<br />
      <br />
      The Flack(x) parameter can be computed and ranked for each Bijvoet pair. In this
      example, 1/10 of the pairs give a Flack(x) of less than -0.64, 1/8 of less than
      -0.50 etc. The mid point of the distribution gives a Flack(x) of -0.03. The mean
      Flack(x) is refined by iterative reweighting to try to exclude inaccurate
      data.<br />
      The Lepage analysis uses the numbers of reflections with the same or opposite signs
      for ranges of increasingly unreliable data. The distribution can be used to provide
      a robust estimate of the probability that the structure has been assigned the
      correct chirality.<br />
