<h4>Wilson Plot</h4>
<p>
This shows the usual ripple due to repeated molecular motifs.
The gradient gives an estimate of the overall adp, the intercept
an estimate of the overall scale of the data. Note the conventional
use of <b>B</b> for the adp. <br>
B=8.pi<sup>2</sup>U <br>
Low values of <b>MOD[E<sup>2</sup>-1] </b> (&lt; 0.74) may
indicate twinning.<br>
If the high-rho end of the curve is ragged, 
or shows an up-turn (due to systematic over-estimation of weak 
reflections), a maximum value of rho for the
rest of the analysis can be selected by right-clicking
on the appropriate blue cross.  This value can be reset
at any time in the REFINEMENT/FILTERING menu. The LIST 28
check box enables you so see the effect of reflection filters.<br>
