<h3> Fo vs Fc</h3>
<p>
The green line is unit gradient.  The reflections (red crosses) should
be distributed evenly about this line. Blue crosses are reflection
that have been filtered out (LIST 28).  If the red crosses follow
a systematic downwards curve at high values of Fc, this may indicate 
the need for an extinction correction. A few point falling a long way 
from the line may be outliers (bad values of Fo), or may indicate
serious erroes in the model (bad values of Fc).  They can be filtered 
out of the refinement by right clicking on them, but only if you are
confident that you can explain them. A slight systematic trend for Fo 
to be greater than Fc, plus more scatter than usual, may indicate 
twinning.<br>
The blue crosses at Fc=zero are reflections that have been filtered out
from the very start. Go to Refinement-Filter Reflections and uncheck the 
filters if you want to compute all Fc values.
