CRYSTALS has two different refineable parameters to help with the 
determination of absolute structure. <br>
The oldest, the Rodger's "eta" parameter is a multiplier onto f", and 
takes the value +1 if the model has the correct hand, and -1 if it needs 
inverting. Flack showed that this parameter is unreliable as eta 
approaches zero.<br>
The Flack "x" parameter is the mixing term in 
<br> F^2 = (1-x)F^2+h + xF^2-h <br>
and takes the value zero if the model has the correct hand, and +1 if it needs 
inverting.  <br>
Either the Rodger's or Flack parameter should be refined simultaneously 
with the other structural parameters since its value will influence 
them, and they in turn will influence the s.u. on the absolute 
configuration parameter.<br>
<strong> Interpreting the Absolure Configuration Paramters</strong><br>
<p style="font-size:80%">
If the s.u. on the Flack parameter is greater than 0.30, the X-ray data 
contain no significant anomalous information so that the absolute configuration
cannot be assigned by X-ray means. The value of x can be set to zero and not refined.
 (It may be appropriate to report x and its s.u. to demonstrate that the 
calculation was actually performed).  <br>
If the s.u. is small enough (<0.04), then the parameter itself can be evaluated.  
If it falls close to zero or unity, then the absolute configuration has been determined.
If it falls within this range, but is significantly distant from the bounds, 
the material is probably twinned by inversion.
</p>
<p style="font-size:100%">
Hooft, Straver and Spek have devised a new parameter which examines the 
anomalous differences computed with the Flack x set to zero.  Its 
robustness has yet to be determined.
