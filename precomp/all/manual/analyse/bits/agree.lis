<h4>Residual</h4>
<p> Plots &lt;(Fo-Fc)<sup>2</sup>&gt; vs Fc and resolution (red)
and &lt;w(Fo-Fc)<sup>2</sup>&gt; vs Fc and resolution (blue).
The blue bars should all be very short and centred at about 1.0.  
In this example there is a systematic trend as a function of both
Fc and resolution.  Since high angle reflections are generally weak,
these two curves are saying more or less the same thing. In this case
almost all blue bars hang down from the unit coordinate, indicating
that the weights need re-adjusting (REFINEMENT/WEIGHTS). 

<p> 
CRYSTALS can try to determine a weighting scheme for you.
<br> For refinement against F<sup>2</sup> a scheme similar to 
Sheldrick's scheme is avaiable.
<br>For refinement againts Fo an optimal Chebychev polynomial is fitted 
to the residual.
<br>
When the weights have been correclty assigned, the weighted residual
for any batch of reflections should be about unity.
</p>


<br>The second 
image shows the result of recomputing the weights.  One strong and 
one weak batch still have large blue deviations, but the green curve 
shows that only a few reflections are involved in these batches.

<h4>Class/Parity (index, R-factor, R by class etc)</h4>
<p>
These are diagnostics which may point to problems with the data 
or model in difficult cases. <i>Residual</i> and <i>R</i> 
by parity/class should be constant across the calsses. 
If there is alternation or some other pattern, this may indicate
pseudo-translational symmetry. Examine the SIR ouput file for
an alternative diagnostic. The Residual and R by index should also
be contant. <br>
In this example, the blue bars are consistantly below unity (but
otherwise fairly constant) indicating that the weights need rescaling.
