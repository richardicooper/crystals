<h2> Availability</h2>

Utrecht. The WINDOWS version is compiled and distributed by courtesy of
Louis Ferrugia at Glasgow.  The compiled executable, which is free for
not-for-profit use,  must be obtained from Louis directly.

<h2> Environment Variables</h2>
<p>
The executable is accompanied by a small file, <b>check.def</b>, which 
contains the definitions of the various checks.  It is usually in the 
same folder as the executable. PLATON will look for this file using the 
"environment variable" CHECKDEF.

To set the environment variable, go to

<h2> Moving PLATON</h2>
The first time you run PLATON, CRYSTALS invites you to browse to find 
the executable.  After that, the location is stored in the Registry.  If 
you move PLATON to a different location, you will have to browse for it 
again.
