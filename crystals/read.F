C
C Revision 1.50  2005/01/23 08:29:11  rich
C Reinstated CVS change history for all FPP files.
C History for very recent (January) changes may be lost.
C
C Revision 1.2  2004/12/13 16:16:08  rich
C Changed GIL to _GIL_ etc.
C
C Revision 1.1.1.1  2004/12/13 11:16:08  rich
C New CRYSTALS repository
C
C Revision 1.49  2004/02/25 10:02:11  stefan
C Removed gui output not GILGIDWXS versions
C
C Revision 1.48  2004/02/18 12:08:23  rich
C Added option \SET TIME SLOW which prevents output of DATE and TIME strings.
C This is to be used by the new test_suite so that runs at different times
C generate no significant differences. Also supresses timing functions, as
C for \SET TIME OFF.
C
C Revision 1.47  2004/02/17 13:37:21  rich
C Extend some CSYS filenames to 256 characters. At the same time fix
C wrong addresses of last four CSYS units since last week when the
C character variables were extended, but the addresses were unchanged.
C (Affecting MAP and CIF files).
C
C Revision 1.46  2003/09/29 15:38:34  rich
C Added \DEFINE system instruction for building the command file. No
C need for separate executable anymore. This command is \REMOVEd in
C the normal startup file to prevent accidents.
C
C Revision 1.45  2003/08/05 11:11:12  rich
C Commented out unused routines - saves 50Kb off the executable.
C
C Revision 1.44  2003/07/03 10:41:04  rich
C Bug fixed: When top level scripts were called, the status bar shows them
C as being called from the last top level script that was run. Fix: Clear
C variables in between script runs.
C
C Revision 1.43  2003/07/01 16:47:24  rich
C Don't update the prompt information ['!','>',' '] in the GUI unless the
C input unit is the command line. Considerably reduces pointless GUI traffic.
C
C Revision 1.42  2003/05/15 17:26:28  rich
C Addition of one extra ENDFILE statement seems to
C make the system request queue work properly under g77.
C
C Revision 1.41  2003/05/07 12:18:55  rich
C
C RIC: Make a new platform target "WXS" for building CRYSTALS under Windows
C using only free compilers and libraries. Hurrah, but it isn't very stable
C yet (CRYSTALS, not the compilers...)
C
C Revision 1.40  2003/03/06 12:01:59  rich
C Clear ! prompt between reads.
C
C Revision 1.39  2003/02/20 16:04:10  rich
C Don't put prompt in the text output in the GUI version. However, we may
C set the "STATIC" text object XPRMPT to the prompt text.
C
C Revision 1.38  2003/01/21 12:54:11  rich
C Commented out swathes of unused code in order to shrink
C the executable a bit.
C
C Revision 1.37  2003/01/16 11:42:13  rich
C Use new SAFESET instruction to update various GUI elements - if they
C don't exist, the program ignores the instruction. Means you can now
C remove or rename guimenu.srt to drop to a really basic version of
C CRYSTALS without getting lots of warnings.
C
C Revision 1.36  2003/01/15 15:26:38  rich
C Removal of NCAWU calls throught the standard SFLS refinement instruction. If
C anywhere will benefit from less IO, it's here.
C
C Revision 1.35  2002/10/14 12:33:24  rich
C Support for DVF command line version.
C
C Revision 1.34  2002/08/23 09:02:26  richard
C Change for script names in status bar.
C
C Revision 1.33  2002/03/15 16:50:01  richard
C Type #SET BONDTYPE OFF to suppress bond type calculation.
C
C Revision 1.32  2002/03/15 11:30:09  richard
C Fix problem where bond types are not calculated on opening a new structure.
C
C Revision 1.31  2002/02/27 19:40:10  ckp2
C RIC: Increased input line length to 256 chars. HOWEVER - only a few modules know about
C this extra length. In general the program continues to ignore everything beyond
C column 80. The "system" commands (OPEN, RELEASE, etc.) do know about the extra length
C and can take extra long filenames as a result. The script processor also knows: lines
C in script files, the script input buffer and text output may now run up to 256 chars.
C RIC: THe system commands respect double-quotes around arguments, so that filenames can be
C given which contain spaces.
C
C Revision 1.30  2002/02/20 14:34:01  ckp2
C Update KRDARG to respect double quotes when reading off arguments. Updated
C KSYSIN not to use KRDARG, but to pass double quotes straight into KDETCH.
C
C Revision 1.29  2001/10/23 15:23:38  ckp2
C Send filenames regardless of ISSUPD status (this should only affect the sending of the model).
C
C Revision 1.28  2001/07/11 10:17:31  ckpgroup
C Change Format statement in BENCH
C
C Revision 1.27  2001/06/18 12:23:38  richard
C Change all script names to lower case before attempting to open the file.
C This is the one place where mixed case would be very confusing - especially
C as the exisiting scripts use random case when calling other scripts.
C
C Revision 1.26  2001/03/18 10:32:05  richard
C
C No longer send info about monitor file to the GUI.
C
C Revision 1.25  2001/03/08 14:36:04  richard
C Pass file names of punch, log, list and mon files from KRDOPN, if ISSUPD is set
C to one.
C If error occurs, do output on white on red.
C
C Revision 1.24  2001/01/17 11:06:02  richard
C Fixed logging of everything.
C Things which aren't logged: #SCRIPT, #USE, $, #SPAWN. This should
C make the log file entirely self-contained with no dependency on external
C files or programs.
C
C Revision 1.23  2000/12/01 17:08:55  richard
C RIC: Removed calls to experimental CSD code #EMAP and #EMAP2
C
C Revision 1.22  2000/10/30 15:35:10  CKP2
C fix some lowercase
C
C Revision 1.21  2000/10/04 16:57:46  CKP2
C set benchmarking
C
C Revision 1.20  2000/09/20 12:42:24  ckp2
C Allow shell commands to be processed immediately, even if script awaiting input.
C Add "SCRIPTS - Awaiting action" to status bar, when appropriate.
C Move "IGNORED/ERRORS" back 5 spaces so that it doesn't overflow 80 chars.
C
C Revision 1.19  2000/07/11 11:04:10  ckp2
C Extra argument to KFLOPN, for specifying SEQUENTIAL or DIRECT access
C
C Revision 1.18  2000/01/20 16:56:22  ckp2
C djw  remove old diagnostic
C
C Revision 1.17  1999/12/23 17:29:31  ckp2
C djw  fix unwanted output in Monitor file
C
C Revision 1.16  1999/12/15 14:54:53  ckp2
C djw  Add set autoupdate on/off, force ON in summary.
C
C Revision 1.15  1999/10/22 11:47:26  ckp2
C RIC: Uncommented the secret CSD stuff.
C
C Revision 1.14  1999/07/22 11:31:55  richard
C RIC: Made sure that the 'Script running' message, (now 'Script Mode'), appears
C after a read so that it doesn't replace useful Cameron status messages
C such as distances and angles.
C
C Revision 1.13  1999/07/15 10:54:34  richard
C RIC: Changed "Script waiting for input" message to "Script running", which
C is more true, especially when the script isn't waiting for input.
C
C Revision 1.12  1999/07/02 17:54:50  richard
C RIC: Moved the "Script awaiting input" message so that it prints
C every time, not just on first entry to KRDREC.
C
C Revision 1.11  1999/07/02 12:51:52  richard
C RIC: Increase parameter NADR from 68 to 69
C RIC: Increase NSSLEN from 13 to 14
C RIC: Increase NSSCHR by 64 from 640 to 704
C RIC: Add 'MAP' to list of values in CADDR.
C RIC: Add 641 to list of pointers to stored information.(ITRADR)
C RIC: Added 14 to end of ITRAD2 list.
C RIC: Added 64 to list data lengths in ITRLEN.
C
C Revision 1.10  1999/06/22 12:51:00  dosuser
C RIC: Added some more informative text for the status bar. It now
C distinguishes between waiting for commands, directives or script input.
C
C Revision 1.9  1999/06/03 17:23:42  dosuser
C RIC: Added Linux Graphical Interface support.
C
C Revision 1.8  1999/05/26 17:26:46  dosuser
C djw  add CSYS identifier 'CIF' for cif file names
C
C Revision 1.7  1999/05/21 11:47:28  dosuser
C RIC: Added section (commented out) for testing the CSD derived
C validation code.
C
C Revision 1.6  1999/05/10 17:09:10  dosuser
C RIC: Fixed so that atomic co-ordinates will be displayed as soon
C     as they become available. Previously you would have to either close
C     the program or re-call #SET TERM WIN. After the call to XWININ(IN)
C     LUPDAT was set to FALSE if no model was available. Now it isn't since
C     if there is no model, XGDBUP will simply return without doing anything
C     anyway.
