C
C All program sub-units now RETURN to the main CRYSTL() function inbetween commands.
C The changes made are: in every sub-program the GOTO's that used to loop back for
C the next KNXTOP command have been changed to RETURN's. In the main program KNXTOP is now
C called at the top of the loop, but first the current ProgramName (KPRGNM) array is cleared
C to ensure the KNXTOP knows that it is not in the correct sub-program already. (This
C is the way KNXTOP worked on the very first call within CRYSTALS).
C
C We now have one location (CRYSTL()) where the program flow returns between every command. I will
C put this to good use soon.

C Implementation of Lists 40 and 41.
C ===================================
C New commands:
C #LIST 41 - contains a list of bonds and bondtypes. It is generated by typing
C #BONDCALC which calculates bonds from LIST1,2,5,29 and 40.
C 40 contains info about how to do the bond calculation and can override
C covalent radii, force or break specific bonds and set limits for pairs
C of elements.
C #PUNCH 40 A - produces a LIST 40, #PUNCH 40 B - produces a #BONDING command
C which may be used to input a list 40 in a more user friendy manner (no READ
C card). #BONDING may also be used to EXTEND an existing list 40.
C #SUM L 40 - summary of bonding building info. #SUM L 41 - the bonds.
C #BONDCALC creates a L40 if there is none, and also only carries out calculation
C if significant change has occured to L5. (unless "#BONDCALC FORCE").
C See manual for more details.
