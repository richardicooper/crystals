C
C TAKES A CSD-TYPE DATA FILE AND GENERATES FROM IT A GRAPH

C
C CNAME  = NAME OF FILE

C        = 1 FOR ATOM GRAPH

C
C NO NEED TO BUILD THE GRAPH IF INTYPE .NE. (TYPE OF FILE GIVEN)
C
C FILE FORMAT:
C 0. FILES ARE READ FROM TOP TO BOTTOM(!) (IE IN THE NORMAL WAY)
C    IN 80-CHARACTER RECORDS.  LINE LENGTHS > 80 ARE TRUNCATED.
C 0.5 FILE READING IS NOT CASE-SENSITIVE
C 1. SPACES AT THE BEGINNING OF LINES ARE IGNORED.
C 2. UNTIL A LINE BEGINNING `END' IS FOUND, ONLY LINES STARTING
C    WITH `AT', `BO' OR `DI' ARE READ.
C 3. IF AN `END' IS NOT FOUND, THE FILE READ IS ABORTED IN ERROR.
C 4. WHEN LOADING A GRAPH, STOP READING AT THE `END' LINE.
C 4.5 `AT' RECORDS LOOK LIKE THIS:
C      AT3 C 3 E
C 5. I.E. THE `AT' IS FOLLOWED IMMEDIATELY BY AN INTEGER SERIAL
C    NUMBER FOR THE ATOM.  THIS SERIAL NUMBER, RATHER THAN THE ORDER
C    OF THE ATOM IN THE FILE, GIVES THE ATOM SERIAL NUMBER.
C 6. THE SECOND ITEM IN AN `AT' RECORD IS THE ATOMIC SPECIES.
C 7. THE NEXT ITEM IS THE NUMBER OF CONNECTED NON-HYDROGEN ATOMS.
C 8. CURRENTLY IGNORE OTHER INFO ON THIS LINE, EG `E' INDICATING
C    THAT THERE MUST BE EXACTLY THIS NUMBER OF CONNECTED ATOMS
C 8.5 `BO' RECORDS LOOK LIKE THIS:
C      BO 3 14 1
C 9. `BO' RECORDS FOLLOW.  THEY CONSIST OF `BO' FOLLOWED BY THE
C    TWO INTEGER SERIAL NUMBERS (FROM THE ABOVE LIST OF ATOMS)
C    WHICH THE BOND IS BETWEEN, SEPARATED BY ANY NUMBER OF SPACES.
C 10. THE THIRD INTEGER IN A `BO' RECORD IS THE BOND ORDER, NOT
C     USED AT PRESENT, BUT WILL EVENTUALLY BE USED, POSSIBLY WITH
C     A LOOKUP TABLE OF BOND LENGTHS, TO GIVE A BOND LENGTH.
C 11. OUT OF ORDER INTEGERS/CHARACTERS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR.
C 12. ANYTHING ELSE IN A `BO' RECORD IS IGNORED.
C 13. AFTER THE FIRST `BO' RECORD, `AT' RECORDS CAUSE AN ERROR
C 14. INCONSISTENCIES BETWEEN `BO' AND `AT' RECORDS WILL CAUSE AN
C     ERROR.
C 15. DUPLICATE BONDS ARE NOT CHECKED FOR
C 16. A CONTIGUOUS SERIES OF SERIAL NUMBERS STARTING AT 1 MUST BE GIVEN
C     STILL MAKE SPACE TO STORE THE SERIAL NUMBER IN CASE IT'S DECIDED T
C     HAVE SEPARATE SEQUENCE & SERIAL NUMBERS
C 17. 'DI' RECORDS LOOK LIKE THIS:
C     DI 1 2 1.53 0.2
C     IE THE FIRST TWO FIELDS ARE ATOM SERIAL NUMBERS, THE NEXT TWO ARE
C     THE REQUIRED DISTANCE BETWEEN THESE ATOMS AND THE TOLERANCE
C     - IE A STRUCTURE WILL MATCH IF DISTANCE = 1.53 +/- 0.2
C
C HOW IT WORKS:
C  READ THE ATOMS & THE BONDS INTO STORE BELOW LFL
C  WHEN THEY'RE ALL THERE (IE WHEN 'END' IS READ) COPY THEM DOWN IN THE
C  NECESSARY FORMAT (IE BONDS AS NODES OR ATOMS AS NODES)
C  CREATE THE ATOM LIST AT THE END OF THE GRAPH
