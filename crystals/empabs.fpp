C
C All program sub-units now RETURN to the main CRYSTL() function inbetween commands.
C The changes made are: in every sub-program the GOTO's that used to loop back for
C the next KNXTOP command have been changed to RETURN's. In the main program KNXTOP is now
C called at the top of the loop, but first the current ProgramName (KPRGNM) array is cleared
C to ensure the KNXTOP knows that it is not in the correct sub-program already. (This
C is the way KNXTOP worked on the very first call within CRYSTALS).
C
C We now have one location (CRYSTL()) where the program flow returns between every command. I will
C put this to good use soon.
