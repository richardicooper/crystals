C Revision 1.4  2003/06/24 12:48:38  rich
C
C RIC: The implementation of the SAME restraint. The first group on the card is the 'target'
C all following groups are mapped onto it (in order specified) and the distances and
C angles restrained - using the connectivity of the first group.
C
C The first two arguments are the e.s.d for bond length restraints and the e.s.d
C for angle restraints. Groups are seperated by the word 'AND'.
C I.E:
C
C SAME 0.01, 0.1 FOR RESI(1) AND RESI(2)
C   maps all atoms in resi(1) onto all the atoms in resi(2) - note that
C   although this shorthand is appealing, the order of resi(1) and resi(2)
C   must be identical in List 5, although the residues may interpenetrate.
C
C SAME 0.01 , 0.1 CONT C(17)  C(18)  H(183) H(182) H(181) AND
C CONT                 C(17)  C(18)  H(182) H(181) H(183)
C   imposes 3-fold symmetry on a single methyl group.
C
C SAME 0.01 , 0.1 CONT C(17)  C(18)  H(183) H(182) H(181) AND
C CONT                 C(17)  C(19)  H(193) H(192) H(191) AND
C CONT                 C(8)   C(9)   H(93)  H(92)  H(91) AND
C CONT                 C(8)   C(10)  H(103) H(102) H(101) AND
C CONT                 C(14)  C(15)  H(153) H(152) H(151) AND
C CONT                 C(14)  C(16)  H(163) H(162) H(161)
C   restrains six methyl groups to have the same geometry as each
C   other. Combining the last two restraints would make all the
C   methyls have 3 fold symmetry, and all be the same.
C
C Errors are generated if
C   1) the size of any of the groups on the SAME card is not the
C      same as the first group.
C   2) the element type in a group does not match the corresponding
C      element type in the first group.
C
C Warnings are printed if there are zero bonds to any of the atoms
C in the first group.
C
C The comma separating the e.s.d arguments, and the 'FOR' separating the
C e.s.d.s from the atom specifications are optional.
C The second e.s.d is optional, the default is 0.1 degrees.
C The first e.s.d is optional unless you wish to specify the second, the
C default is 0.01 Angstroms.
C
C List 41 (bonds) is loaded by the restraint generating routine, if it
C does not exist an error will occur. (By default L41 is kept up to date
C with the current model.)
