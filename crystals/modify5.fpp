C 2) Report error if vector has zero length.
C
C Revision 1.45  2004/03/09 09:38:03  rich
C
C Added a 'ROTATE' directive to #EDIT. There are three modes of operation:
C
C   rotate angle px py pz vx vy vz [atoms]
C   rotate angle patom vx vy vz [atoms]
C   rotate angle patom vatom [atoms]
C
C The first rotates the specified [atoms], angle degrees around the vector
C vx,vy,vz keeping point px,py,pz fixed. (px-pz and vx-vz are given in
C crystal fractions).
C
C The rotation is in an orthogonal system so all distances and angles
C within the moved set of atoms are preserved.
C
C The second notation replaces the point to keep fixed with patom, the name
C of an atom. Its coordinates are used to obtain px py and pz.
C
C The third notation uses patom to get px, py and pz, and the vector from patom
C to vatom to get vx, vy and vz.
C
C Examples:
C
C 1) Rotate the hydrogens of a methyl group by sixty degrees.
C
C     #EDIT
C     ROTATE 60 C(1) C(2) H(20) H(21) H(22)
C     END
C
C 2) Turn a phenyl ring through 30 degrees around its rotation axis.
C
C     #EDIT
C     ROTATE 30 C(1) C(20) C(21) C(22) C(23) C(24) C(25)
C     END
C
C 3) Flip a residue 90 degrees around the a-axis about its centroid, QC(1)
C    (see also CENTROID and INSERT RESIDUE directives)
C
C     #EDIT
C     INSERT RESIDUE
C     CENTROID 1 RESIDUE(1)
C     ROTATE 90 QC(1) 1 0 0 RESIDUE(1)
C     END

C Oops. Don't assume that real cell parameters are inverse of reciprocal. Fixed.
C
C Revision 1.42  2003/09/15 15:27:06  rich
C Upgraded TRANSFORM directive to handle transformations of ADPs better.
C Rotation matrix, R, was applied: Unew = RUR', which only works properly
C when all cell axes are identical length. Instead, we use
C Unew = inv(N)RNUN'R'inv(N)', where N has the reciprocal cell lengths
C along its diagonal.
C
C Revision 1.41  2003/09/11 19:41:22  rich
C Transformation matrix was applied incorrectly to Uij tensor. Now fixed.

C Remove unnecesary updating of the GUI during #EDIT with GUI HIGH set
C on.

C REmove line break in print.
C
C Revision 1.38  2003/06/27 11:59:04  rich
C Globally replace FRAGMENT (slot in L5) and FRAGMENT(...) lexical keyword
C with RESIDUE. This should reduce confusion about what it is, and as FRAGMENT
C is only months old, no-one should notice the change anyway. So now it is
C #EDIT
C DELETE RESI(1) RESIDUE(2)
C END
C to delete residues 1 and 2.
C
C Revision 1.37  2003/06/20 13:38:23  rich
C
C Fix bug in #EDIT/DELETE when using the new PART,RESIDUE or TYPE
C keywords to select atoms - the change in size of L5 in between
C calls to KATOMU was confusing things - as a result only half
C the atoms requested were being deleted.
C
C Revision 1.36  2003/05/07 12:18:54  rich
C
C RIC: Make a new platform target "WXS" for building CRYSTALS under Windows
C using only free compilers and libraries. Hurrah, but it isn't very stable
C yet (CRYSTALS, not the compilers...)
C
C Revision 1.35  2003/02/27 12:48:35  rich
C Special case PART, REFINE and RESIDUE in #EDIT CHANGE, so that values
C get stored as integers.
C
C Revision 1.34  2003/02/27 11:39:50  rich
C Code to INSERT RESIDUE id into RESIDUE slot in List 5. The maximum residue number
C is returned to scripts (if they are listening) in the variable 'EDIT:FRAGMAX'.
C This is the first of many places that this method will be used.
C
C Revision 1.33  2002/12/16 18:00:27  rich
C New Perturb command. Allows per parameter shift multipliers, and a general
C multiplier to apply to all shifts. The shifts respect weights setup in
C List 22 so that atoms do not move from special positions, and competing
C occupancies continue to add up to the same number. By default it creates
C new list 5s, but can be forced not to by directing: "WRITE OVER=YES".
C Shifts for XYZ are given in Angstrom, for OCC in natural units, for overall and
C temperature factors as a fraction of the existing value.
C
C Revision 1.32  2002/10/14 12:33:24  rich
C Support for DVF command line version.
C
C Revision 1.31  2002/07/25 15:58:05  richard
C New DRENAME directive for #EDIT, renames an atom, but moves any existing clashes
C out of the way. (Next unused serial for that atom type.)
C
C Revision 1.30  2002/07/23 15:55:45  richard
C Load lists 3,29,40 and 41 *BEFORE* the ordered list 5, otherwise what's going
C to happen when you add an ATOM? That's right: a mess.
C
C If MONGUI is 2 then update the model. Recalculate bonds first as #edit has
C the power to muddle the order of L5 around which makes the bond list
C pointers go wrong.
C
C Revision 1.29  2002/07/23 10:02:09  richard
C
C INSERT NCONN and INSERT RELAX use L41 to work out bonding. L41 is dangerously
C useless if L5 has been sorted in #EDIT. One can now call XBCALC(2) to recalculate
C bonds. L5 is not reloaded in this mode.
C
C Revision 1.28  2002/07/22 08:11:15  richard
C
C Added new #EDIT directive: CLASH. MODE=REPORT, FIXLATTER or FIXFORMER. Either
C just reports clashes, or fixes them (FIXLATTER changing serials lower down
C the list, and FIXFORMER changing those higher up the list.) The new serial is
C chosen to be one higher than ANY existing serial in L5.
C
C Revision 1.27  2002/07/18 17:11:58  richard
C If 'monitor' is set to off, and users 'QUIT's from #EDIT, then don't print
C the warnings. This allows SCRIPTS to sneakily do things without alarming
C the user with what looks like error messages.
C
C Revision 1.26  2002/07/17 09:29:49  richard
C
C In #DISTANCE added option: SEL RANGE=L41
C This will use the bond list (41) to determine what is connected.
C
C In #DISTANCE added option: OUT PUNCH=DELU D1DEV=x D2DEV=y
C This will output VIBR restraints to the punch file with an esd
C of x for 1,2 distances and y for 1,3 distances. You probably want an
C EXCL H if using the DELU option.
C
C In #DISTANCE added option: OUT PUNCH=SIMU S1DEV=x S2DEV=y
C This will output U(IJ) restraints to the punch file with an esd
C of x for normal bonds and y for terminal bonds. A bond is terminal
C if it connects to an atom with no other connections except hydrogen.
C This option uses LIST 41 to determine whether the atom is 'terminal',
C but the RANGE can still be set at user's discretion. You probably want an
C EXCL H if using the SIMU option.
C
C In #EDIT added option: INSERT NCONN
C This will put the number of connections to other atoms (according to L41)
C into the SPARE slot in List 5.
C
C In #EDIT added option: INSERT RELAX
C This will start with the electron count of each atom in SPARE, and
C keep cycling through the bond list, adding the current value of
C SPARE to all the neighbouring atoms. It will cycle until the number
C of unique values of SPARE stops increasing.
C
C distangl.src now contains a routine KDIST4, which works like KDIST1 but using
C the existing L41. It should be noted that the bond lengths stored in L41
C may be out of date as the bonding is only recalculated every now and again.
C

C
C Revision 1.24  2002/05/15 10:13:26  richard
C New EDIT command - GUISELECT, works like select and typechange, but doesn't
C modify L5, just selects the atoms in the window.
C e.g. #EDIT/GUISEL SPARE LT 40/END selects all atoms where spare < 40.
C Warning: if you execute a command that changes list 5 in the same #EDIT
C block the selections will be lost on END, as the L5 is updated.
C
C Revision 1.23  2002/05/08 08:51:50  richard
C New EDIT directive GRAPH OF=SPARE
C plots a graph of whatever is in the SPARE column in L5. (You need to have
C an appropriate plot window open or nothing happens.)

CODE FOR XMOD05
      SUBROUTINE XMOD05
C--SUBROUTINE TO ALTER THE LIST 5 STORED
C
C        THIS ROUTINE ALLOWS THE USER TO EDIT A LIST 5 OR 10. THE
C      OUTPUT LIST CAN BE EITHER A LIST 5 OR 10. DIRECTIVES ARE
C      EXECUTED AS THEY ARE TYPED IN.
C
C        A NEW LIST WILL BE CREATED ONLY IF THE OLD LIST IS CHANGED,
C      OR THE LIST TYPE IS CHANGED. IN INTERACTIVE MODE A NEW LIST
C      WILL BE CREATED EVEN IF THERE ARE ERRORS UNLESS THE USER ENDS
C      WITH A 'QUIT' DIRECTIVE. IN OTHER MODES, NO NEW LIST IS CREATED
C      IF AN ERROR OCCURS.
