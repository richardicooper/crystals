  CRYSTALS can prepare data in a suitable format for the Direct Methods
  programs  SHELXS and SIR.
  It can also prepare data for a SHELXS Patterson, or compute a Patterson
  itself.
  The programs SHELXS and SIR may not all be available in all
  implementations of CRYSTALS. In some cases, the 'foreign' program can
  run from within CYSTALS, other wise the user must initialise its
  execution.
