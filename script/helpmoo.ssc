The left histogram shows the number of reflections with a given multiplicity.
The end bin contains reflections having a multiplicity of 20 or more.



The right histogram shows the average multiplicity as a function of resolution.



 The observed theta range is divided into 20 equal intervals in
 (sin(theta) / lambda)**3.  This ensues that each bin 
 contains roughly the same number of reciprocal lattice points.
