 The easiest data formats to start with are CAD4 data, DIP data, or
 SHELX ins or res and hkl files.

 Before you start CRYSTALS make a new directory and copy your data into it.
 Choose this directory when you start CRYSTALS.

 For SHELX files, you will need to know the space group. Using the menus
 above choose X-ray data -> SHELX ins or res and follow the instructions.
 Then choose X-ray data -> Reflections and read in the HKL file.

 For CAD4 data, use the external program RC93 ( choose X-ray data ->
 Pre-process -> Cad4 data -> Run RC93. When done, choose X-ray data ->
 Pre-process -> Cad4 data -> Input processed data and follow the
 instructions.

 For DIP data, use the external program DIPIN ( choose X-ray data ->
 Pre-process -> Dip2000 data -> Run Dipin. When done, choose X-ray data ->
 Pre-process -> Dip2000 data -> Input processed data and follow the
 instructions.

 Once your data has been read in by CRYSTALS, it is stored in a binary file
 in your working directory. Next time you start CRYSTALS, you can continue
 where you left off.

 If you have no model structure use the Solve menu to initiate Direct
 Methods programs.

 If you have a trial or partially refined model, choose Refinement ->
 Guided-Automatic for structure refinement and publication listings.
