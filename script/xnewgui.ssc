{I The easiest data formats to start with are CAD4 data, DIP data, or
{I SHELX ins or res and hkl files.

{R Before you start CRYSTALS make a new directory and copy your data into it.
{R Choose this directory when you start CRYSTALS.

{I For {2,14SHELX{I files, you will need to know the space group. On the
{I menu choose X-ray Data -> SHELX ins or res and follow the instructions.
{I Then choose X-ray Data -> Reflections to read in the HKL file.

{I For {2,14CAD4{I data, use the external program RC93 ( choose X-ray Data ->
{I Pre-process -> Run RC93. 

{I For {2,14DIP{I data, use the external program DIPIN ( choose X-ray Data ->
{I Pre-process -> Run Dipin. 

{I For {2,14Kappa CCD{I data, use the external program KCCDIN ( choose X-ray
{I Data -> Pre-process -> Run KCCDin. 

{I Once your data has been read in by CRYSTALS, it is stored in a binary file
{I in your working directory. Next time you start CRYSTALS, you can continue
{I where you left off.

{R             Click "Guide" on the toolbar (or "Refinement->The Guide"
{R                  in the menu), for advice on what to do next.
