This is the recommended method for routine structures.  The automatic re-weighting 
or filtering may cause all Friedel Pairs to be rejected, in which case the alternative
methods may give some insight into the problem.

Post-refinement Absolute Structure Determination written by 
Pascal Parois to automatically filter out un-useful reflections.
     Calculate Studentized residual &
     Detection of outliers in weighted least squares regression

Additional filters can be set manually if required.

The various computations are carried out using all reflections, using 
manually filtered reflections and using automatically filtered reflections.

If no plots appear, try reducing the value of Filter(1), the minimum
acceptable (calculated signal) : (observed noise) or swap to the Diffference method.


Three output files are created:
absolute_configuration.dat     A full listing of the reflections for external analysis
bijvoet_fit.lis                The columns if data in y=mx where y is the observed Friedel 
                               difference, x is the computed Friedel difference and 
                               m=1-2*Flack_Parameter
Parsons_fit.lis                The columns of data in y=mx where y is the observed Parsons 
                               Quotient, x is the computed Parsons Quotient  and 
                               m=1-2*Flack_Parameter

                             HISTOGRAM Graph
If the end bins of the Ds/sigma(Do) curves are almost empty it indicates
that you have very few enantiomer-sensitive reflections.  


                               SIGNAL Graph

The 'Signal' graph plots the average (computed signal):(observed noise) ratio 
for equal intervals in (Sin(theta)/Lambda)**3.  This ensues that each bin 
contains roughly the same number of reciprocal lattice points.  Some points 
may then be rejected because of the filters.

The number of bins is selected to give about 100 rlu points in each bin.
