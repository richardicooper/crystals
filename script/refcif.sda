# Text of the abstract 
# (a) The Abstract must be self-contained and comprehensible
# without the rest of the paper.  This means no references
# to atom names or to compound numbers; compounds must be
# identified as the title compound, or by name or by some other
# means such as derivatives of each other (e.g. "the
# corresponding ketone").
# (b) The chemical formula of "the title compound" must be given.
# (c) Any crystallographic molecular symmetry should be
# mentioned, and also the presence of more than one molecule
# in the asymmetric unit (i.e. anything other than Z'=1).

In the absence of significant anomalous scattering, Friedel pairs were
merged. 

The absolute configuration was arbitrarily assigned. 

The relatively large ratio of minimum to maximum corrections applied 
in the multiscan process (1:nnn) reflect changes in the illuminated 
volume of the crystal.   

Changes in illuminated volume were kept to a minimum, and were 
taken into account (G\"orbitz, 1999) by the multi-scan inter-frame 
scaling (DENZO/SCALEPACK, Otwinowski & Minor, 1997).

The H atoms were all located in a difference map, but those 
attached to carbon atoms were repositioned geometrically.  
The H atoms were initially refined with soft restraints on the 
bond lengths and angles to regularise their geometry 
(C---H in the range 0.93--0.98, 
N---H in the range 0.86--0.89 
N---H to 0.86 
O---H = 0.82 
\%A) 
and  
U~iso~(H) (in the range 1.2-1.5 times U~eq~ of the parent atom), 
after which the positions were refined with riding constraints.
