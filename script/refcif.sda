Because the data were collected with molybdenum radiation, there were no 
measurable anomalous differences, as a consequence of which it was
admissible to merge Friedel pairs of reflections.

All hydrogen atoms were found in difference density syntheses.

Hydrogen atoms were placed geometrically after each cycle.

Hydrogen atoms were placed geometrically after each cycle, the preferred
orientations of those groups whose conformations could not be assigned
unambiguously having been previously identified by examination of a 
difference Fourier map.  

Hydrogen atoms were seen in a difference density synthesis. Those
attached to carbon atoms were repositioned geometrically.

Hydrogen were initially refined with soft restraints on the 
bonds to regularise their geometry (bond lengths to accepted values, 
angles either set by symmetry or to accepted values, and 
U[iso] dependent upon the adjacent bonded atom),
after which they were refined with riding constraints only.


donated by Bill Clegg:

The H atoms were all located in a difference map, but those 
attached to carbon atoms were repositioned geometrically.  
The H atoms were initially refined with soft restraints on the 
bond lengths and angles to regularise their geometry (C---H = 0.97--1.01,
O---H = 0.94 \%A), after which they were refined as riding, with U(H) =
1.2U~eq~(C) for those bonded to carbon, and U(H) = 0.05 \%A^2^ for the 
hydroxy group.
