Direct refinement od the Flack parameter does not NEED Friedel pairs, though
the calculation is strengthened if pairs are present.
Similarly, Hole-in-One does not NEED pairs, but if they are present they 
improve the calculation.

Difference and quotient methods MUST have Friedel pairs.

                         DIFFERENCE & QUOTIENT

The Difference and Quotient analyses implemented here are old procedures, and 
will probably be replaced by the semi-automatic 'Pascal' method in due course.

If no plots appear, try reducing the value of Filter(1), the minimum
acceptable (calculated signal) : (observed noise)

                             HISTOGRAM Graph
If the end bins of the Ds/sigma(Do) curves are almost empty it indicates
that you have very few enantiomer-sensitive reflections.  


                               SIGNAL Graph

The 'Signal' graph plots the average (computed signal):(observed noise) ratio 
for equal intervals in (Sin(theta)/Lambda)**3.  This ensues that each bin 
contains roughly the same number of reciprocal lattice points.  Some points 
may then be rejected because of the filters.

The number of bins is selected to give about 100 rlu points in each bin.
