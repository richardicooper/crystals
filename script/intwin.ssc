{I CRYSTALS has no special difficulty in refining twins - your
{I problem will be to collect and index the data, and solve the
{I the structure.

{R This SCRIPT assumes that you have a recognisable structure 
{R either already in CRYSTALS, or available in SHELX format files. 

{I For a two element twin:
{R You will be asked for the twin law.
{R The reflection file will be converted automatically.
{R The twin element scales will be added to list 5, and the guided
{R refinement will allow you to refine the two elements along with
{R the rest of the structure.

{I For three or more element twins:
{R You will need to edit list 5 for yourself (instructions are provided),
{R and create appropriate restraints for the refinement.
