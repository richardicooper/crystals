Getting Started
===============-
If you have got here, you will probably have clicked the CRYSTALS icon.
You should have selected a drive letter, and a folder containing your 
basic X-ray data. 

PROBLEMS:
 1 You didn't prepare a folder with the basic data. 

     Either:
       open a DOS box and create a folder and load (from pen drive, 
       ftp, E-mail etc) the basic data.
     or:     
       a) Click My Computer
       b) Select drive letter ( eg C:)
       c) Click File -> New folder. While the text New Folder 
          is still highlighted in blue, change the name to 
          something useful.
       d) Click on folder, and copy X-ray data files into 
          folder from some where else (ftp, pen drive, Neighbourhood etc.)
       e) Close My Computer

     On the CRYSTALS menu, choose File, New Working directory, and find 
     the drive with your folder on it. Highlight the folder and click OK. 

 2 The wrong molecule appears in the window, or no molecule appears when 
   you expected one.

     You are in the wrong folder. 

     On the CRYSTALS menu, choose File, New Working DIrectory, and find 
     the drive with the correct folder on it. Highlight the folder and click
     OK.

 3 You need to get the data into CRYSTALS

     On the toolbar menu, Select DATA
     Either:
       select Guided Import
     or:
       select Data Files (Current)
     or:
       select Shelx (INS or RES) file

     Select reflection data.

     Select SOLVE 

     Etc,etc

Note: You can add c:\wincrys; to your path. This will permit you to run 
CRYSTALS from the prompt in a dosbox in the correct data directory, by
just typing CRYSTALS.
