Getting Started


If you have got here, you will probably have clicked the crystals icon. 
You should have selected a drive letter, and a folder containing your 
basic X-ray data. 

PROBLEMS:
 1 You didnt prepare a folder with the basic data. 

      Either 
             open a DOS box and create a folder and load (from floppy, 
             ftp etc) the basic data.
      or     
             Click My Computer
               Select drive letter ( eg C:)
                 Click file – new – folder. While the text New Folder 
                 is still highlighted in blue, change the name to 
                 something useful.
                   Click on folder, and copy X-ray data files into 
                   folder from some where else (ftp, floppy, 
                   Neighbourhood etc)
             Close My Computer

      On the CRYSTALS toolbar, choose File, New Working DIrectory, and find 
      the drive with your folder on it. Highlight the folder and click OK. 

 2 The wrong molecule appears in the window, or no molecule appears when 
   you expected one.

      You are in the wrong folder. 

      On the CRYSTALS toolbar, choose File, New Working DIrectory, and find 
      the drive with the correct folder on it. Highlight the folder and click OK. 

  3 You need to get the data into CRYSTALS

      On the toolbar, Select X-ray data

      Either 
            select Preprocess/CAD4/DIP2000
      or
            select Shelx (INS or REF) file

      select reflection data.

      Select SOLVE 

      Etc,etc


Note: You can add   driveletter:\wincrys; to your ‘path’. This will permit you to run 
CRYSTALS from the prompt in a dosbox in the correct data directory, by just typing 
CRYSTALS
