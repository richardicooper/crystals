To automatically renumber atoms so that adjacent atoms
have adjacent serial numbers, type:
#REGROUP
SELECT TYPE=ALL SEQUENCE=YES

 You don't need to click on the input line
 before typing. Just type and the focus will
 snap to the input box.
%   END BLOCK
%   BLOCK     %TIP3%
 While the input line has focus (flashing
 cursor), you can use the Up and Down cursor
 keys to review your command history.

 Choose Save As... from the File menu to write
 out a CRYSTALS DSC file with all the current
 data in. CRYSTALS will automatically re-start
 using this file.

 The script directory contains hundreds of files
 written in a simple scripting language. They may
 be used for anything from automating repetitive
 tasks to controlling the course of the whole
 analysis.

 When you are entering a block of commands (i.e.
 after you have type #something, you can add atoms
 to the command line by clicking them with the left
 mouse button.
%   END BLOCK
%   BLOCK     %TIP7%
 When you are not entering commands, left clicking
 on atom causes it to be selected. The right mouse
 button will display a context sensitive menu when
 clicked in the model window dependent on whether
 the click is in space, on an atom, or on an atom
 of a selected group.
%   END BLOCK

 Drag the model with the left mouse button to rotate
 it.

 For'Routine' work try following the menus from left
 to right.
 You can't access most menu commands while a script
 is running.

 If the scripts get into a tangle then it is probably
 the script-writers fault for not making allowance
 for user error :) Get out of script mode by typing
 DIRECT. If the scripts die and leave a window open
 which appears to be blocking your input, then clicking
 the close button 7 or 8 times in a row will cause
 it to failsafe and close.

 The CRYSTALS manuals can be found in the subdirectory
 \manuals\ where you installed the program. They are
 available in postscript and HTML.

Common probelms:
If no reflections are found during QUICKSTART, then the
filename or the format statement may be incorrect.
Check the filename, and that the format statement
is enclosed in brackets.
%   END BLOCK
%   BLOCK     %TIP13%
Common probelms:
If structure factor calculations fail with error messages
about atoms of type Q, then there are peaks remaining from
a Fourier search still in the atom list. 
Edit the atom list:
1) With the mouse in the MODEL window
2) From the menu item STRUCTURE / REMOVE FOURIER PEAKS
3) Directly from the command line e.g.
     #EDIT
     SELECT TYPE NE Q
     END
%   END BLOCK
%   BLOCK     %TIP14%
Common probelms:
If DIFABS fails, either there are no values for Fc, or
no orientation matrix. Compute structure factors (#SFLS
enter, CALC enter, END) or input a matrix (LIST 13,
there is a script INLIST13).
%   END BLOCK

Did you know?
Regarding partially occupied special positions: The
occupation factor given in the atom parameter list,
LIST 5, is the 'chemical' occupancy, and so is always unity
for a non-disordered site.
If the atom is on a special position, the 'crystallographic'
occupancy (multiplicity) is computed automatically, and
multiplied onto the 'chemical' occupancy.
To force CRYSTALS to use unit crystallographic occupancy
(and thus only use the term stored as occupancy in LIST 5),
set the UPDATE parameter in LIST 23 to NO. There is a script,
(INLIST23) to help you. You will then need to take care of all
occupation factors manually.

If you can only vaguely remember the syntax of a command,
a) look in the PRIMER (chapter 16 & 17),
b) if you have already started the command type a '?'
   on the next line,
c) issue #COMMANDS command
%   END BLOCK
%   BLOCK     %TIP17%
Common problems:
If you see Read/Write error on unit 1, (the data base),
you may have filled you hard disk, or not enabled automatic
disk file extension. Type:
#DISK
EXTEND SIZE=100 TRIES=100

 Hold down CONTROL or SHIFT and click on the
 model with the left mouse button to zoom in
 and out.
%   END BLOCK
%   BLOCK     %TIP19%
Use
#LIST 28
MINIMA RATIO=n
END
to set the threshold ratio I/sigma(I) for 'unobserved' reflections.
%   END BLOCK
%   BLOCK     %TIP20%
Order the atoms in the atom list so that atoms which
need to be addressed together are adjacent in the list.
You can then use an 'UNTIL' sequence to refer to them.
These commands contain facilities to help with this:
#COLLECT
#REGROUP
#EDIT
%   END BLOCK
%   BLOCK     %TIP21%
If you have multiple similar fragments (e.g. phenyl
groups), number the atoms so that they can easily be
addressed in commands with an editor
e.g.
c(101) until c(106), c(111) until c(116)
%   END BLOCK
%   BLOCK     %TIP22%
If you have lots of phenyl groups, and not much data.
Use restraints to permit a valid anisotropic refinement.
E.g. for the group P(1)-C(1).....C(6)
 
#LIST 16
 
# first the geometry - this will enforce pseudo 6 fold symmetry, but you
could make it 2 fold.
PLANAR              P(1) C(1) UNTIL C(6)
ANGLE 180, .1 =     P(1) to C(1) to C(4)
DIST  0,  .01 =MEAN C(1) TO C(2) C(2) TO C(3) C(3) TO C(4)
CONT                C(4) TO C(5) C(5) TO C(6) C(6) TO C(1)
DIST  0,  .01 =MEAN C(1) TO C(3) C(2) TO C(4) C(3) TO C(5)
CONT                C(4) TO C(6) C(5) TO C(1) C(6) TO C(2)
DIST  0,  .01 =MEAN C(1) TO C(4) C(2) TO C(5) C(3) TO C(6)
 
# now bond stretching restraints
VIB   0,  .01 =     C(1) TO C(2) C(2) TO C(3) C(3) TO C(4)
CONT                C(4) TO C(5) C(5) TO C(6) C(6) TO C(1)
 
# now angle flexing restraints
VIB   0,  .01 =     C(1) TO C(3) C(2) TO C(4) C(3) TO C(5)
CONT                C(4) TO C(6) C(5) TO C(1) C(6) TO C(2)
VIB   0,  .01 =     C(1) TO C(4) C(2) TO C(5) C(3) TO C(6)
 
# so far, we have no restraints on the out-of-plane components of Uij
# set up similarity restraints.
U(ij)  0, .02 =     C(1) TO C(2) C(2) TO C(3) C(3) TO C(4)
CONT                C(4) TO C(5) C(5) TO C(6) C(6) TO C(1)
U(ij)  0, .03 =     C(1) TO C(3) C(2) TO C(4) C(3) TO C(5)
CONT                C(4) TO C(6) C(5) TO C(1) C(6) TO C(2)
VIB    0, .03 =     C(1) TO C(4) C(2) TO C(5) C(3) TO C(6)
 
Note that the atom list on each bond restraint also occurs in
a vibration restraint and a similarity restraint.
There is a script which will set these up for you. The
geometrical rigidity can also be imposed as a constraint
(with GROUP in LIST 12), though in this case the group must
be idealised before refinement begins (#REGULARISE).
%   END BLOCK
%   BLOCK     %TIP23%
Hydrogen atoms can be found or placed geometrically
(#PERHYDRO or #HYDROGEN). They can then be refined
freely, or as riding atoms (RIDE, in LIST 12). I prefer
NOT to refine them in the least squares (except perhaps
for hydrogens in hydrogen bonds), but to delete them and
recompute ideal positions after every 2 or 3 cycles. Put
the instructions to delete and create the H atoms in a
file, which can be #USEd as required.
PERHYDRO also creates a pro-forma files for hydrogen re-
placement and refinement -
RIDEH.DAT
PERH.DAT
If you edit these for future use, remember to also change their name.
%   END BLOCK
%   BLOCK     %TIP24%
Refinements of highly correlated parameters or ones ill-defined
by the data tend to 'blow up'. Don't try to fix this by refining
different parameters in different cycles - this only hides the
problem. Use shift limiting restraints (in LIST 16).
e.g.
LIMIT .01 U[ISO].
This will limit the shifts in U[iso] to about .01 per cycle.
The effects of successive cycles are cumulative. All parameters
can be limited like this. The units are the same as the parameters.

To quickly see a slant Fourier map through a plane of atoms
in your structure:
1) Select the atoms to define a plane. (Click each once)
2) Right click one of the selected atoms for a context-menu.
3) Choose 'Slant Fourier Map'
%   END BLOCK
%   BLOCK     %TIP26%
If the R factor is sticking at a high value, Use DIFABS in
analyse mode. (Click Analyse, DIFABS)
The map shows a function of the ratio Fo/Fc as a function of
Crystal orientation. If thEre are high peaks or troughs, there
may be something wrong with the data, e.g.
Absorption
Anisotropic extinction
Crystal not centred
Crystal badly mounted
Crystal damaged
%   END BLOCK
%   BLOCK     %TIP27%
For large structures, the time taken to update the model window
may be excessive. It can be inhibited by creating a
      CRYSINIT.DAT
file in the current directory. This file can contain anything
you wish to execute every time you start CRYSTALS on that
compound - e.g.
 
#set autoupdate off
#set export on
#set watch 5
#set lists both
 
Note: #set autoupdate on/off can be issued at any time CRYSTALS
is running. The autoupdate flag is not used by #DISPLAY, which
always updates the model.

Do you know about the command #PURGE?  This clears space inside the .DSC
for re-use. It does not make the .DSC smaller, but you could type
#PURGE xxx
to get a new, small file xxx.dsc
or #PURGE DATE
to get a file abcdef.DSC , where abcdef is the date and time.  Very
useful for e-mailing or archiving CRYSTALS data.
