{12,0 ANALYSIS OF RESIDUALS      w(Fo - Fc)**2 versus /Fc/                            

In the table, examine the weighted residual                                     
(headed w(delta)**2, column 3 from the right). Towards                          
the end of a refinement, this should be approximately                           
constant as a function of Fo (or any other systematic                           
ranking). If there is a systematic trend, then there                            
is a systematic trend in the data which has not been                            
modeled in the structure. You should verify that the                            
structure is essentially correct, i.e. not in a false                           
minimum. In particular, check columns 2 and 3, sum Fo                           
and sum Fc. If, towards the bottom (i.e. strong                                 
reflections), <Fo>/<Fc> is substantially less than unity, 
you may need to include an isotropic EXTINCTION parameter 
in the least squares. Restore unit weights before starting 
the extinction parameter refinement.                                                
                                                                                
If the parameters you are refining have 'reasonable'                            
values, you should attempt to correct the data for the                         
<Fo>/<Fc> trend, or introduce suitable additional 
parameters to the model. See, for example, DIFABS.                                            
                                                                                
If you can do neither of these, then you should modify                          
the refinement weights to minimise the problem.                                 
                                                                                
In the absence of specific technical advice, try automatic                      
weighting. CRYSTALS  uses different methods for F and Fsq                       
refinement. Choose the scheme which gives a sufficiently                        
constant distribution with the minimum number of parameters.                    
                                                                                
Occasional ranges having a large residual can be ignored in                     
routine work.                                                                   

{12,0 CHOOSING WEIGHTS

It is dangerous to use a weighting scheme which has a dependancy
on the mode (e.g. Chebychev or SHELX) in the early stages since
a poor model may adversely down-weight important reflections.
Unit Weights are usually excellent for refinement against F

Simple Staistical weights (in which the observed sigma(I) values
are augmented by a small contribution from the structure amplitude)
are good for refinement against F^2.

Once the model is complete and the refinement is partially converged
CRYSTALS will try to select and optimise a weighting scheme for you.


{12,0 QUASI-UNIT WEIGHTS                                                              
      (w = 1.0 for F refinement, 1/(2F) for Fsq refinement)                       
      This scheme is the most suitable for initial refinements,                 
ie until the model is fully parameterised.  It is rarely advisable              
for the final refinement since it leads to poor error estimates
and will generate a checkcif error.

      This scheme is most suitable for development stage refinement                 
 of good quality data free from serious systematic error, and where
 the model is complete and well behaved.                                         
                                                                                
{12,0 ROBUST STATISTICAL
      (w=1/(SigmaSq))
      This scheme is suitable for the case where the bulk of the data
 has small systematic errors, but may contain a few refelctions with
 serious casual errors, such as might occur from a high pressure cell

{12,0 MODIFIED SHELX
      w= 1.0 / ( sigma^2 + (aP)^2 + bP ), P = (Fo + 2Fc)/3                      
      or P=(Fo^2 + 2Fc^2)/3 depending on refinement against F or F^2.           
 This is a very popular weighting scheme. The parameters a and b                
 are determined automatically in order to give a goodness of fit of             
 approximately one and a flat analysis of variance across all ranges            
 of Fc.

      (w=function of residual)                                                  
      This scheme is more flexible than the Modified SHELX scheme.                   
It tries to compensate for errors in both the data and the model, and           
give optimal values for those parameters which are being refined.               
CRYSTALS tries to choose the optimal terms depending upon whether the
