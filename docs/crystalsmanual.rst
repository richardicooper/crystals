Version 14 of CRYSTALS is based on a
version (Issue 2) written by J.R. Carruthers in collaboration with
J.S.Rollett during 1977-78, which was a rewrite of the 1975 CRYSTALS 
system implemented  
on the ICL 1900 series of computers. It contains significant
contributions by Paul Betteridge, David Kinna, Lisa Pearce, Allen Larson,
and Eric Gabe and many students and visitors to the Chemical
Crystallography Laboratory, Oxford. The graphical user interface (GUI)
was written by Richard Cooper as part of a Part II and D
Phil project (supported by a CCDC studentship) in collaboration with
Ludwig Macko and Markus Neuburger in Basel, who were working on a
parallel Macintosh interface.

While CRYSTALS can still be executed in 'batch mode' (ASCII file in,
ASCII file out), the major demand is now for the version running under
Windows, with some small demand for the
LINUX version. The GUI permits the user to continually see the structure
as it develops, and to interact with it and the analysis through
conventional windows features. The 'command line' and 'use file' modes
have been retained for experienced users, or users wishing to explore
new ideas. The 'SCRIPTing' language has been extended to enable full
control and design of the user interface to be handled from ASCII files.
